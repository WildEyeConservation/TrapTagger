<h4> Spatial Capture-Recapture Summary</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Spatial Capture-Recapture</strong> analysis provides comprehensive abundance estimates, detection probabilities, and sigma estimates for a species, leveraging spatial information to enhance accuracy. The Spatial Capture-Recapture summary includes the following key components:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>SCR Data Summary</strong>
        <p>
            Provides a summary of data used in the SCR analysis, including the number of individuals, sampling occasions, and sites. It also includes mean maximum distance move (MMDM) and half the mean maximum distance move (HMMDM) per individual. A zero MMDM may indicate incomplete data or issues with site coordinates.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>AICc</strong>
        <p>
            Presents AICc values for each model, allowing model comparisons. The model with the lowest AICc value is considered the best fit.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Density per 100km<sup>2</sup></strong>
        <p>
            Offers density estimates per 100km<sup>2</sup> for the best model, along with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Abundance</strong>
        <p>
            Displays abundance estimates for the best model, including standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detection Probability</strong>
        <p>
            Shows detection probability estimates for the best model, along with standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Space use (sigma)</strong>
        <p>
            Provides space use estimates for the best model, including standard errors and 95% confidence intervals.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
