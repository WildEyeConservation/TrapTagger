<p align="justify">
    Here you can view information about the selected individual as well as edit your individual. 
</p>

<p align="'justify">
    To edit the individual you can remove the currently selected image from the individual by clicking on the 
    associated button, or delete the entire individual if it isn't salvageable. Deleting the individual will dissolve the individual 
    and create a new individual for each detection that was associated with the deleted individual. You can edit the individual's name or notes by typing in the appropriate
    text box. You can edit the tags associated with the individual by selecting the applicable checkboxes. After you have edited the individual's name, tags, or notes, you can save these changes by clicking on the
    submit changes button.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can filter and order the images associated with the individual. You can filter the images by the site that is associated with the image by selecting a site from 
    the drop down menu. You can also filter the images by their timestamp by selecting a date range from the date range picker. You can order your images according to 
    timestamp, site, and detection rating. To do this, select the appropriate option from the drop down menu as well as the ascending or descending option.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can also view statistics about your individual. Select the type of analysis you would like to view from the drop down menu. The analysis types are:
    Naive Activity Analysis, Spatial Analysis, Numerical Analysis and Temporal Analysis.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The naive activity analysis is a time-based analysis of your individual, allowing you to view your individual's sightings as a function of the time of day. This in turn allows you to 
    determine the activity of the individual within the park. Further, you have the ability to view this information as a function of your camera traps (site) as well within a 
    specific date range, allowing you to potentially find patterns of movement within the reserve. You can also switch between seeing the statistics on an image, detection, or cluster level. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The spatial analysis is a space-based analysis of your individual, where you can view your individual's sightings as a function of space, which in turn allows you to determine the area 
    of your individual. Again, you have the ability to view this data on either an image, cluster, or detection level. You also have the ability to specify a date range if you want to view where
    your individual has been seen for a specific date range. Further, you have the option 
    to normalise the heatmap by the site density across the reserve. This helps reduce the biasing effect of there being more sightings in areas with more cameras. The radius parameter 
    allows you to change the radius thrown by each site in the heatmap, essentially changing the size of the area averaged, which can help illuminate different patterns. Note that 
    on the top right-hand corner of the map, you have the ability to switch between different maps: a selection of Google-owned and open-source satellite and street maps.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The numerical analysis allows you to view the sightings in a simple bar-graph format, where you can view the number of sightings for your individual at specific sites. Again you can specify a date range for when you want to view the sightings as well as selecting for which site 
    you want to view the information. You can view this data on either an image, cluster, or detection level.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The temporal allows you to view the sightings as a function of time, which in turn allows you to analyse the counts of your individual over time. Again you can specify a date range for when you want to view the sightings as well as selecting for which site
    you want to view the information. You can view this data on either an image, cluster, or detection level. You can specify the time unit as a number of days, months, or years.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    <i>Note that you are able to obtain extra information by mousing over the graphs and maps. In the case of graphs, you will be shown the count associated with a column, whilst 
        for a map you will be shown the name of the site.
