    Naive Activity Analysis
</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Naive Activity Analysis</strong> provides insights into the total counts for selected data combinations (species and sites) as they vary over time of day.
    This analysis is valuable for identifying the peak activity times of species. You can add multiple data combinations to compare the activity patterns of different species.
</p>

<p>
    Key features of the Naive Activity Analysis include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Data Unit: Customize the level of data aggregation (e.g., clusters, images, sightings, <em>x</em> time to independence).</li>
    <li>Normalisation: Adjust for variations in data by normalising the counts.</li>
    <li>Data Combination: Select the species and site combination for analysis.</li>
    <li>Chart Type: Choose the most suitable chart type for data visualization.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can export the generated chart as a PNG image by clicking the <em>Export</em> button. Further chart customization can be done in the <em>Chart Options</em> settings.
