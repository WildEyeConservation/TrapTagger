    Here you are able to edit your survey in four ways:
</div>

<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        Classifier version: The current AI version used to classify the species contained in your survey is displayed here. If there is a newer version available, the update 
        option becomes available. This will then re-classify the images in your survey using the latest classifier version. Thereafter you can either run a classifier check on your old 
        tasks, where you can manually check the descrepancies between your labels and the new classifier's labels, or create a new task using the new classifications. In the case of the 
        latter, you can also use the comparison functionality in the results section to compare the new task to any old tasks you might have had.
    </li>

    <li>
        Add images: Add images to your already-existing survey. This can be in the form of a new camera, new trapgroup, or even missing images from the intitial upload. Any duplicate 
        images will be ignored, and the new images seemlessly imported to your survey. As before, you must enter a trapgroup code before selecting an upload method and uploading/importing accordingly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Add coordinates: Upload a new kml file for your survey. The file can contain modifications to old coordinates, coordinates for the entire survey, or even coordinates for only a subset of the entire 
        survey. Either way, only matched trapgroups will have their coordinates changed according to what is contained in the file.
    </li>

    <li>
        Edit camera timestamps: Adjust each camera's clock by setting the timestamp of its first image to the correct time. This can be used to correct for incorrectly set up cameras. Please 
        note that this can be done at any time, but it is recommended that you should do it right away before creating your first task. Failing that, you should rather wait until you have resolved the 
        clusters containing multiple species.
    </li>
</ul>
