    Here you are able to edit your survey in eight ways:
</div>

<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        Classifier version: The current AI version used to classify the species contained in your survey is displayed here. If there is a newer version available, the update 
        option becomes available. This will then re-classify the images in your survey using the latest classifier version. Thereafter you can either run an AI check check on your old 
        annotation sets, where you can manually check the descrepancies between your labels and the new classifier's labels, or create a new annotation set using the new classifications. In the case of the 
        latter, you can also use the comparison functionality in the results section to compare the new annotations to any old annotations you might have had.
    </li>

    <li>
        Coordinates: Edit the coordinates of your sites. This can either be done manually (in decimal degrees format), or using a kml file. The latter is simply the Google Earth format. Just ensure that your 
        placemark names match your site names in order for the system to know which one is which. Note that having coodinates fo your sites is entirely optional, 
        and is only necessary for map based results or if you wish to include coordinates in you csv files.
    </li>

    <li>
        Camera timestamps: Adjust each camera's clock by setting the timestamp of its first image to the correct time. This can be used to correct for incorrectly set up cameras. Please 
        note that this can be done at any time, but it is recommended that you should do it right away before creating your first annotation set. This can be done at either a folder or camera level.
    </li>

    <li>
        File Timestamps: Edit the timestamps of your images and videos. Please note that this can be done at any time, but it is recommended that you should do it right away before creating your first annotation set. The timestamps can be edited in three ways:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Missing Timestamps: If you have any images or videos without timestamps, you can add the timestamps here.
            </li>
            <li>
                Extracted Timestamps: Here you can view and edit the timestamps that were extracted from an image or video if it was not possible to extract the timestamp from the image or video's metadata.
            </li>
            <li>
                Edited Timestamps: View and edit the timestamps that were manually added to an image or video that had no timestamp or whose extracted timestamp was corrected.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Area: View and edit the area that your survey is located in. You have the ability to select an existing area or create a new area. You also have the ability to edit the name of the area the survey is associated with. 
    </li>

    <li>
        Advanced options: Select whether the system should ignore small detections or those in the sky. This reduces the number of false detections due to birds in exchange for some reduced accuracy.
    </li>

    <li>
        Masks: View and edit the masks you have created during the annotation process. You can review what detections have been masked, and add, edit or remove masks as you see fit.
    </li>

    <li>
        Static Detections: View and edit the detections that were marked as static. You can edit whether the idenitified static detections are correct or not. It is recommended that you do this
        before creating your first annotation set.
    </li>

    <li>
        Structure: View the structure of your survey. This is useful for checking that your survey has been set up correctly.
    </li>
</ul>
