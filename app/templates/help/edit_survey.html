    Here you are able to edit your survey in seven ways:
</div>

<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        Classifier version: The current AI version used to classify the species contained in your survey is displayed here. If there is a newer version available, the update 
        option becomes available. This will then re-classify the images in your survey using the latest classifier version. Thereafter you can either run an AI check check on your old 
        annotation sets, where you can manually check the descrepancies between your labels and the new classifier's labels, or create a new annotation set using the new classifications. In the case of the 
        latter, you can also use the comparison functionality in the results section to compare the new annotations to any old annotations you might have had.
    </li>

    <li>
        Files: Add files (images and/or videos) to your already-existing survey. This can be in the form of a new camera, new trapgroup, or even missing files from the initial upload. Any duplicate 
        files will be ignored, and the new files seamlessly imported to your survey. As before you can upload the new files through your browser.
    </li>

    <li>
        Coordinates: Edit the coordinates of your sites. This can either be done manually (in decimal degrees format), or using a kml file. The latter is simply the Google Earth format. Just ensure that your 
        placemark names match your site names in order for the system to know which one is which. Note that having coodinates fo your sites is entirely optional, 
        and is only necessary for map based results or if you wish to include coordinates in you csv files.
    </li>

    <li>
        Camera timestamps: Adjust each camera's clock by setting the timestamp of its first image to the correct time. This can be used to correct for incorrectly set up cameras. Please 
        note that this can be done at any time, but it is recommended that you should do it right away before creating your first annotation set. This can be done at either a folder or camera level.
    </li>

    <li>
        Advanced options: Select whether the system should ignore small detections or those in the sky. This reduces the number of false detections due to birds in exchange for some reduced accuracy.
    </li>

    <li>
        Masks: View and edit the masks you have created during the annotation process. You can review what detections have been masked, and add, edit or remove masks as you see fit.
    </li>

    <li>
        Static Detections: View and edit the detections that were marked as static. You can edit whether the idenitified static detections are correct or not. It is recommended that you do this
        before creating your first annotation set.
    </li>

    <li>
        Structure: View the structure of your survey. This is useful for checking that your survey has been set up correctly.
    </li>
</ul>
