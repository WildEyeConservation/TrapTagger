    Spatial analysis
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The spatial analysis is a space-based analysis of your survey, where you can view species sightings as a function of space, which in turn allows you to determine which areas
    or biomes contain more or less of a particular species. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The data unit determines on what level you ar viewing the counts. You can apply a date range to limit the time period.  Further, you have the option to normalise the heatmap by the trap density across the reserve. This helps reduce the biasing effect of there being more sightings in areas with more cameras.
    The radius parameter allows you to change the radius thrown by each trap in the heatmap, essentially changing the size of the area averaged, which can help illuminate different patterns. Note that 
    on the top right-hand corner of the map, you have the ability to switch between different maps: a selection of Google-owned and open-source satellite and street maps. Finally, should you wish to 
    see a heatmap for all species in the park, you have the option to exclude empty images, knocked down cameras, and images containing vehicles, humans, and livestock. This allows 
    you to actually see the heatmap for the animals in the reserve.
