    Spatial analysis
</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Spatial Analysis</strong> is a powerful tool that allows you to explore species sightings in relation to space, providing valuable insights into species distribution and habitat preferences.
</p>

<p>
    Key features of Spatial Analysis include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Unit Selection:</strong> Choose the data unit level to view species counts, allowing you to focus on clusters, images, sightings, or custom <em>x</em> time to independence levels.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Species Selection:</strong> Select the species you wish to analyze, allowing you to focus on specific species or all species in the reserve.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Normalisation:</strong> Optionally, normalise the heatmap by trap density across the reserve. This reduces bias in areas with more cameras, providing a more accurate view of species distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Radius Adjustment:</strong> Modify the radius parameter to control the size of the area-averaged, helping you reveal different patterns in species distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Map Selection:</strong> Choose from a variety of map options, including Google-owned and open-source satellite and street maps, to visualize species distribution effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Exclude Irrelevant Data:</strong> Customize your analysis by excluding empty images, knocked-down cameras, and images containing vehicles, humans, and livestock. This allows you to focus solely on the heatmap for the animals in the reserve.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Relative Abundance Index:</strong> Optionally, normalise the heatmap by site effort days to calculate the Relative Abundance Index (RAI). This allows you to compare species distribution across sites with different operational periods.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once you've configured your analysis, you can export the map as an image by clicking the <em>Export</em> button. Please note that only OpenStreetMaps can be exported.
</p>

<p>
    Spatial Analysis empowers you to uncover spatial patterns in species distribution, making it an essential tool for habitat assessment and conservation efforts.
