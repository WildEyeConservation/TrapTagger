    Welcome to the data pipeline page. Here you can prepare images for classifier training by running them through a detector, and cropping out 
    the animals. Additionally, all necessary information is stored in your database for easy annotation extraction at a later stage.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by specifying the name for the survey you are processing, and the name of the bucket where you would like your training data to be 
    stored. Alongside that, you must also specify the minimum detection size you would like to use, and a site identifier for differentiating different 
    camera sites. The latter is helpful to prevent the classifier from learning species distributions in particular habitats.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Next you must specifiy the source of your data. If the data is stored in extrernal cloud storage, you can specify the base URL where the images 
    should be fetched from, along with a csv file stipulating each filename and its associated label.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Alternatively, you can import your own S3-stored data by specifying an S3 bucket and folder to import. In such a case, you would need to import 
    the labels separately from a csv file using the "add task" functionaly.
