    Welcome to the label spec page. Here you can generate the label-translation json files requirted for species-classifier training.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by filling in the name of your bucket where you want all your training datat stored.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Next, click on the request button. The first time you do so, there will be no global training csv for it to extract labels from. As such it will 
    start generating this file. Wait a few minutes and click request again. This time it will get all the unique labels from your training 
    data set and populate the associated section of the form.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You will then be able to lok at each label and the asociated number of images associated with it, and either choose to exlude it (by selecting 
    the checkbox), or give it a desired label. This way you can combine a number of different spellings, misspellings, and labelling conventions 
    together. Moreover, you will also be able to group labels into groupings. For example, if you have insufficient data to train a classifier to 
    reliably differentiate different bird species, you could combine all the birds into a single bird label and have the classifier reliably 
    identify birds.
