<h4> Density Map Results</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The density map results is a graph that showcases the density of the species in the state-space as a heatmap. The density map is based on the results obtained from the spatial capture-recapture analysis.
    The density map can either be displayed on a map or as a graph. Both the map and the graph can be exported as an image by selecting the <i>Export</i> button. Please note that only the OpenStreetMaps can be exported.
