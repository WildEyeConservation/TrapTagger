<h4> Density Map</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Density Map</strong> is a powerful visualization tool that illustrates the spatial distribution of a species within a defined area using a heatmap. This representation is generated based on the outcomes of a spatial capture-recapture analysis.
</p>

<p>
    You have two options for viewing the density map:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Map View:</strong> Visualize the density map overlaid on a geographical map. This view provides geographical context and allows you to explore the species distribution in relation to the environment. In the map view you can control the radius of the heatmap. Modify the radius parameter to control the size of the area-averaged, helping you reveal different patterns in species distribution.
    <li><strong>Graphical View:</strong> Alternatively, you can opt for a graphical representation of the density map. This view simplifies the visualization, providing you with a clear graphical representation of the species density distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Both the map and the graph can be easily exported as image files by selecting the <em>Export</em> button. Please keep in mind that exporting is supported only for maps based on OpenStreetMaps.
</p>

<p>
    The Density Map is a valuable tool for understanding the spatial distribution of species, making it an essential resource for ecological and conservation analyses.
