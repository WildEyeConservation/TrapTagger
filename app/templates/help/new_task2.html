    Here you must translate between your labels and the AI's labels. In other words, you must indicate which label each AI classification must 
    be allocated to. Where your labels match those of the AI, they will automatically be associated, so you only need to handle those that remain. 
    Typically, you are simply working around different spellings and scientific names.

<p align="justify">
    Where this process becomes a bit more involved is when you are in a different biome to where the AI was trained. In the simplest case, where 
    you data is from a completely unrelated biome, you can simply leave all the labels to their default tanslation: nothing (ignore). All those 
    species classifications from the AI will then be assumed to be wrong and simply ignored. You could also perhaps still make use of some of the 
    common labels like vehicles and humans if you wish though.

    When your data is from a related biome - for example you have east African data and the classifier was trained in southern Afica - you have a 
    number of options at you disposal. The simplest and most accurate appoach is to simply ignore the non-endemic species as above. However, this approach will 
    result in reduced auto-classification and reduced AI-aids like cluster or image ordering. One alternative is to translate a non-endemic species 
    classification to a similar-looking endemic species. Another is to translate that non-endemic species to its parent category - like antelope for 
    example - to still make use of the classification.

    There is no way to know what approach will work best for your particular biome as it depends on your mix of species, and particular needs - whether 
    speed or accuracy should be prioritised. As such, it is recommended that you play around with the different options to create multiple annotation 
    sets for you first survey to see how the approaches compare. In paticular, if you just create a separate label for each non-endemic species, 
    you could quite easily see if there is a pattern in the species being classified as the correct species, and make a call as to whether there is enough consistency 
    to make a translation. However, if you are unsure or in a hurry, simply ignore all non-endemic species classifications.
