    Here you must indicate which label each AI classification must be allocated to. If you have a label with the same name as one of the classifications, that 
    classification will automatically be allocated to it. However, the remaining classifications must be allocated manually. Please note that this is necessary 
    even if you do not wish to use AI auto-classification as it forms a part of the image ordering, and is used to help you identify clusters with multiple species.

    It is suggested that you either go back and add labels specifically for the classifications that you do not have labels for as there is a good chance that those 
    species exist within the survey. Alternatively, you can create a group label in the correct hierarchical level such as an 'other antelope' label under an antelope label. 
    In the case that your survey is not situated in a Southern African biome, it is suggested that you still try and alocate the classifications to group labels in the correct 
    hierarchical level as the AI is likely to confuse the unknown species of antelope with another species of antelope. This will not affect perforance of manual tagging, 
    and will still help identify clusters that potentially contain multiple species.
