<h4 align="justify">Covariates</h4>

<p>
    Welcome to the Covariates section. Here, you can enhance your analysis by incorporating covariates, which are variables describing specific site characteristics within your reserve. These covariates may include factors like tree cover, distance to water, flash, and more. Covariates play a crucial role in influencing the probability of animal detection at a site and the likelihood of animals occupying a site.

<p>
    To get started with covariates, please follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Manual Entry or CSV Import:</strong> Covariates can be added manually or imported from a CSV file. To import, select the import button, and further instructions will be provided.</li>
    <li><strong>Add Covariates:</strong> Click the "+" button to add a new covariate. Provide a name for the covariate and input its values for the relevant site. Specify whether the covariate values are numeric or categorical. If numeric, you can choose to scale (normalize) the values.</li>
    <li><strong>Export:</strong> If needed, you can export your covariates to a CSV by clicking the export button.</li>
