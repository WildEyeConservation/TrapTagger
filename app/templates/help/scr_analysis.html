<h4> Spatial Capture-Recapture</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Spatial Capture-Recapture</strong> analysis provides the following results based on individuals identified in your dataset:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Capture-Recapture</strong>
        <p>
            Provides a summary of the abundance estimates for your species on capture-recapture models. 
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spatial Capture-Recapture Summary</strong>
        <p>
            Provides comprehensive abundance estimates, detection probabilities, and sigma estimates for a species, leveraging spatial information to enhance accuracy.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Spatial Captures</strong>
        <p>
            A graph of the average spatial locations of the individuals identified in your dataset.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>State Space</strong>
        <p>
            The state space used in the analysis.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Density Map</strong>
        <p>
            Provides a estimated density heatmap for the selected species.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Individual Counts</strong>
        <p>
            Provides a heatmap of the number of individuals detected at each site.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Customize your Spatial Capture-Recapture analysis by selecting observation window days, and selecting the species you want to evaluate. You can also incorporate site-level covariates and individual characteristics, such as sex, into your analysis. You can choose to use the state space that is calculated by default or select 
    to mask your own state space. You can mask your own state space by uploading the corresponding shapefiles or by drawing a polygon on the map. Please note that all applicaple sites should be included in the state space otherwise an error will occur.
</p>

<p>
    The Spatial Capture-Recapture analysis was executed using an R script. You can view the script by clicking the <em>View R Script</em> button. Additionally, download the data used in the analysis as a CSV file by selecting the <em>Download CSV</em> button. The R script includes a function that allows you to load the CSV file into R for further analysis or modifications to suit your needs.

<p>
    This analysis relies on the following R packages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/spatialcapturerecapture/oscr-package">oSCR</a>
        <p>
            oSCR is used to create spatial capture-recapture models and calculate species abundance estimates.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcapture/index.html">Rcapture</a> 
        <p>
            This package is used to create capture-recapture models and calculate abundance estimates for species.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/index.html">raster</a>
        <p>
            The raster package is employed to create a raster object from site coordinates for plotting density maps.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/index.html">sf</a>
        <p>
            sf is used to create a spatial object from site coordinates for plotting density maps.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Please note that Spatial Capture-Recapture operates on an individual level, so complete individual ID is essential for accurate results. Ensure site coordinates are provided for spatial analysis. To initiate the analysis, click the <em>Generate Results</em> button. Be patient, as Spatial Capture-Recapture results may take some time to generate. Avoid navigating away from or refreshing the page while results are processing.
