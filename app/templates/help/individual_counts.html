<h4>Indivdiual Counts</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Individual Counts</strong> result provides a heatmap displaying the individual counts of a species across different sites. This visualization allows you to quickly assess the distribution and density of individuals within your study area.
</p>

<p>
    To access specific individual counts for a site, hover over the corresponding site marker on the heatmap. This feature provides detailed information about the population at each location.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Normalisation:</strong> Optionally, normalise the heatmap by trap density across the reserve. This reduces bias in areas with more cameras, providing a more accurate view of individual distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Radius Adjustment:</strong> Modify the radius parameter to control the size of the area-averaged, helping you reveal different patterns in indivdiual distribution.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can export the map as an image by selecting the <em>Export</em> button. Please keep in mind that exporting is supported only for maps based on OpenStreetMaps.

<p>
    The Individual Counts result is a valuable resource for understanding the spatial distribution and concentration of a species, making it an essential tool for ecological and conservation analysis.
