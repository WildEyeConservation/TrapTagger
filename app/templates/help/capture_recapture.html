<h4> Capture-Recapture Results</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Capture-recapture</strong> analysis provides abundance estimates for a species using capture mark recapture principles. The results table displays these estimates for multiple models. It's important to note that capture-recapture is performed at the individual level and doesn't rely on spatial information for calculation.
</p>

<p>
    Key aspects of the capture-recapture analysis include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Observation Window:</strong> The observation window, specified in days, represents the duration of a sampling occasion.</li>
    <li><strong>Species:</strong> You can apply the analysis to the selected species or all species in the dataset.</li>
</ul>
