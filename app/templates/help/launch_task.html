<div align="justify">
    Here you can launch your annotation set for manual annotation. This can be summarised as follows:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>
        Launched annotation sets appear on the jobs page for your workers to annotate.
    </li>
    <li>
        There are 6 different types of annotation task working from left to right through the list, going from the most coarse information down to the most granular.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each annotation type can also be launched for a particular species of interest.
    </li>
    <li>
        The only compulsory step is the first one in which you have to annotate the top-level species in the species-labelling task. Everything else is optional. You must still 
        do this even if you have selected for all species to be automatically identified for you as there is always some percentage of the dataset on which the AI is insufficiently 
        confident of the species to make a classification.
    </li>
    <li>
        As such, the idea is that you should only annotate the information useful to you, working from left to right, for your particular species of interest. 
        Anything more would be unnecessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Each annotation task is broken down into smaller jobs for your workers to annotate. The batch size determines the number of clusters in each of these jobs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The number in brackets next to an annotation level indicates the number of clusters to annotate for that species and annotation type.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can have as many workers working simultaneously as sites in a survey. Please just ensure that they all have their own accounts.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can manage which workers can annotate for you on the workers page.
    </li>
    <li>
        If there are animals in a sub-category that you have not created a label for, skip them, and then on task completion, add the neccessary label and relaunch the category.
    </li>
</ul>

    More detailled information on the individual annotation types:
</p>

<h4>Species Labelling</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can label the species contained in each cluster. This is done in layers, accoding to your hierarchical label structure. You begin by labelling the unlabelled clusters with 
    your top-level labels. Thereafter, you can individually launch and annotate the group categories for sub-species annotation. The idea is that this approach is simpler and faster 
    as you have fewer labels to work with (and remember) in each pass. You can also leave more challenging categories to more knowledgeable people, or leave them for later if you do not 
    need those particular species annotated at present.
</div>
<br>

<h4>AI Species Check</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can check yourself against the AI to find mistakes. There are no annotation levels - you will always be shown the clusters where your species labels differ from those 
    of the AI.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Empty Label Check</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can check the clusters where no sightings were found in any of the images belonging to the cluster. Please note that the chances of missed sightings 
    are very low and any potential sightings are likely to be of low quality. 
</div>
<br>

<h4>Informational Tagging</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can add your own custom informational tags such as 'eating', 'alert', 'has young' etc. to clusters containing you species of interest. You will be able to set up and edit 
    your tags after you launch the annotation task.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Multi-Species Differentiation</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can differentiate which sighting (box) contains which species in multi-species clusters. This gives you more accuate information on an image level (should only some 
    of the images in a cluster contain one of the species), and results in more accurate animal counts as all boxes in these clusters would otherwise be counted as all annotatated species. 
    There are no annotation levels - you will simply be served all multi-species clusters for annotation.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Sighting (Box) Correction</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can correct the AI-generated boxes for your species of interest. This is a necessary prerequisite for individual identification, as well as if you wish to extract 
    precise animal counts. Note that the default boxes can still be used as a good estimate of the animal counts. They are just less accurate for heard species, but even then 
    are still around 90% accurate.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Individual Identification</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Here you can identify specific individuals of a particular species. There are three levels to this task: cluster identification, inter-cluster identification, and exhaustive.
</div>
<br>
<p align="justify">
    In the first level, you identify individuals within a cluster, using the contextual information at hand to find multiple view angles of each individual. This is particularly 
    useful for combining both sides of an individual, especially when you have multiple cameras per site.
    Here you also have some additional options. Firstly, you can select which individual ID algorithm to use. At present you can either use Hotspotter in conjunction with a 
    heuristic algorithm, or the heuristic algorithm on its own. Hotspotter is a pattern-recognition algorithm that performs well on species like leopards and zebra, but 
    struggles on non-patterned species. As such, it is recommended that you rather use the heurstic on its own for such non-patterned species as it will be detrimental to the identification process.
    Additionally, you can select how single-detection clusters are handled. Since the whole point of this ID stage is to identify individuals within a cluster, there is little 
    point to seeing clusters that contain a single detection, unless you would like to add additional informational tags to those individuals. Therefore, you can chose for 
    those clusters to be automatically handled for you, or for you to handle them manually.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In the second level, you can then identify individuals across clusters based on their calculated similarity down to a pre-defined threshold. You will be allocated an individual 
    and then be offered potential matches that you can either accept, reject, or skip. Skipped pairings of individuals will be removed from the pool until you relaunch this annotation 
    task, with the idea that you can then revisit those pairings when they have more images associated with them.
</p>
<p align="justify">
    In the final level, you can do an exhaustive search across all unchecked combinations of individuals with no threshold. This will allow you to ensure that your individual set is as 
    accurate as possible. Hopefully by this stage you have substantially reduced the number of individuals to the point that this exhaustive search is reasonable.
