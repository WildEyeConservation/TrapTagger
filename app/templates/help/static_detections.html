<p align="justify">
    Welcome to the static detection check page. Here, you can verify whether the following detections contain static objects or not.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    All the detections for a potential static object will be displayed at once. You can determine if the detections are static by selecting the 
    "Accept" or "Reject" button. Alternatively, you can use the 'A' and 'R' hotkeys. If the first image is unclear, you can iterate through the 
    images to confirm if the detected object is static or not. If the detections hide the object, you can hold the Spacebar to temporarily hide the detections.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you make a mistake, you can press the "Undo" button, which will take you back to the previous static detection group.
