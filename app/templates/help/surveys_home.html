    Welcome to your home page. Here you are able to manage your image sets (known as surveys) and their associated annotation sets: add new ones, edit them, launch them for manual annotation sets, 
    and view the results. The entire process of analysing a set of images can be divided into three main steps and a few associated sub-steps:
</p>

<h4 align="justify">
    1. Survey Setup
</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Start by creating a new survey and uploading images to it. A survey is simply a set of images, so you can break up your data into any subsets you wish. You can also always add more 
    images to an existing survey at any time.
</div>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    <i>1a. Annotation-Set Setup</i>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:20px" align="justify">
    Next, you must create a new set of annotations for your survey. Typically, only one annotation set is required, but each survey can have multiple annotation sets associated with it, 
    that can then be compared with each other. This allows you to annotate you data in multiple diffent ways and compare the results, or compare different workers, or benchmark the system 
    against pre-existing annotations. As part of setting up your annotation set, you will be able to define your own custom species labels, as well as select which species you would like 
    automatically identified for you.
</div>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    <i>1b. Edit</i>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:20px" align="justify">
    At any stage you can add additional images to a survey, update the version of the AI used on it, or edit the camera timestamps and site coordinates using the associated edit button. Additionally, 
    you can edit the species labels by clicking on the associated edit annotation set button.
</div>
<br>

<h4 align="justify">
    2. Annotation
</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Once you have created an annotation set for your survey, you can begin annotating it. Note that even if you select for all your species to be automatically identified for you, 
    there will always be some percentage of the images that must be annotated manually due to the AI being insufficiently confident of the species therein. Annotation of a 
    dataset can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks, with each providing more and more granular information. Additionally, each of these tasks can typically be performed 
    on a species-by-species basis, allowing you to only annotate the information you need, for the species for which you need it. Your progress through these steps is outlined under 
    an annotation set's details.
</div>
<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        Species Labelling: annotate the species contained in each cluster of images.
    </li>
    <li>
        AI Species Check: check your manual annotations against the AI to find mistakes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Informational Tagging: add additional informational tags to image clusters to indicate animal behaviour or anything else.
    </li>
    <li>
        Multi-Species Differentiation: differentiate which box contains which species in a multi-species cluster.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sighting (box) Correction: Correct the AI-generated boxes for each animal to get accurate animal counts. Also necessary before individual identification.
    </li>
    <li>
        Individual Identification: Identify specific individuals of a species across your survey.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    <i>2a. Knockdown Analysis</i>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:20px" align="justify">
    As part of the initial level of species annotation, you will have the option to mark a camera as knocked down. This marks all the images from that camera from that point in time 
    onward as knocked down, putting them aside, and thus preventing you from having to look at a bunch of empty images. 
    However, these cameras can sometimes be picked up by passers-by.
    As such, after completing an initial-level species annotation, you will be required to analyse the knocked-down cameras to determine if and when this has occured.
    If a camera was in fact picked up, all those images will then be added back to their respective clusters (in a multi-camera setup) and hence automatically identified as 
    farr as possible. The remaining images must then be annotatated in an top-level species-labelling session, which will automatically be launched upon completion of the 
    knockdown analysis.
</div>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    <i>2b. Unknown Animals</i>
</div>
<div style="padding-left:20px" align="justify">
    Many times a sighting of an animal simply consists of a one or two poor images - a glimpse of a tail, a single leg, or some whiskers - which are near impossible to identify 
    by the average person, but can be ID'd by the expert in your team. These can simply be labelled as unknown in the initial pass through of the survey, and then easily found under 
    the unknown label in the explore function, for your expert to annotate. Alternatively, if you know the animal falls under a broad category such as antelope, but you don't know which 
    species it is, you can tag it as an antelope in your initial pass, and then skip the image during the annotation of that category. Your antelope expert can then simply call up all the 
    unknown antelope by selecting the antelope label under the explore function, or you can simply relaunch the antelope category tagging as normal. In the event that you cannot identify 
    the animal, it will still be tagged as an antelope, and hence can be counted accordingly in your results.
</div>
<br>

<h4 align="justify">
    3. Results
</h4>
<div align="justify">
    Once you have finished annotating your survey to the desired level, you can examine the results in a number of ways by clicking on the results button for that paticular annotation set. 
    There you will be able to look through all the clusters with a desired label in the explore function, or play with a number of interactive analysis tool under the statistical tools. 
    Alternatively, you can download your data in a number of different ways: as a csv file, a formatted excel file, or even as a sorted set of images with the labels in the metadata.
