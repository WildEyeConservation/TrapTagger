    Here you can select which species are automatically identified in this annotation set. As with most things in life, you are offered a trade-off between speed and accuracy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    One approach is to rely on the AI to identify all of the species for you - leaving you with only around 5% of the dataset to manually annotate. These tend to be the more 
    challenging images where the AI is insufficiently certain as to what species they contain, which is why they are rather left fo human annotation. This approach is by far the 
    fastest, but does result in the lowest accuacy due to mistakes by the AI. It tends to be favoured by ecologists who do not have enough man power to manually annotate their 
    data, and where a percentage point or two reduction in accuracy is acceptable.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    On the opposite end of the spectrum, the highest accuracy appoach would be to have no species automatically identified for you. In this case, all the empty images would still be 
    removed, but you would be required to manually annotate the remaining images, where the AI is used as an aid. You can then check you manual annotations against the AI to identify 
    and correct mistakes. This approarch is favoured by universities with a lot of man power at their disposal, where accuracy is of utmost importance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    However, you can find a compromise between these two extremes by selecting only subset of the species to be automatically identified. In particular, the idea is to select 
    very numerous, very different-looking species from your species of interest. So for example, if you are interested in large African predators (lion, lepard, cheetah, wild dog 
    and hyena), then you can fairly safely select species like zebra, giraffe and elephant to be automatically identified for you, with little risk that they will be confused with 
    your species of interest. As such, you can still get a very high accuracy dataset, but with far fewer images to manually annotate.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You also have the option as to whether an identified species should be labelled with it's own label, or it's parent label. For example, should impala be labelled as impala, or as 
    antelope. The latter option is useful where you have some, for example, antelope species that the classifier was not trained for, and you are concerned about those species being 
    confused as other antelope species. In that case, the antelope will be idenified to the antelope level, and you can still manually differentiate the antelope species yourself, 
    ensuring there is no confusion. This is only worthwhile though when there is one or more antelope that are of interest to you.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    In general, if you do not expect to see a particular species in your survey, it is better to err on the side of caution and not have that species auto-classified. This would prevent 
    other species from being mistaken as the unexpected species.
