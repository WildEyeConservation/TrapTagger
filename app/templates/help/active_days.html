    Camera Trap Active Days
</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Active Days Chart</strong> is a heatmap that provides a visual representation of the number of active days for each camera trap over time. This chart helps you understand when the camera trap was active and how many images it captured on specific days. It also offers interactivity, allowing you to zoom in on specific time periods and hover over individual days to see detailed information.

    You can download the chart as a PNG image by clicking the <em>Export</em> button. Customize the chart's appearance in <em>Chart Options</em> to suit your preferences for export.
