    Camera Trap Active Days
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The active days chart is a heatmap that shows the number of active days for each camera trap as a function of time. This allows you to view on which days the camera trap was active and how many images 
    were captured on those days. The chart is interactive and allows you to zoom in on a specific time period. You can also hover over a specific day to see the number of active days for that day.
    A date range filter can be specified to limit the analysis to a specific time period. You can define the camera traps as either a site, camera, or site group.

Please note the summary results may take a while to generate if you have a large amount of data.
