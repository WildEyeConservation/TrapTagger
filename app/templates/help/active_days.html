    Camera Trap Active Days
</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Active Days Chart</strong> is a heatmap that provides a visual representation of the number of active days for each camera trap over time. This chart helps you understand when the camera trap was active and how many images it captured on specific days. It also offers interactivity, allowing you to zoom in on specific time periods and hover over individual days to see detailed information.
</p>

<p>
    You can further refine your analysis by specifying a date range filter to focus on a particular period of interest. Additionally, you have the flexibility to categorize camera traps as either a site, camera, or site group for more granular insights. You can also choose to view data 
    for a particular site or site groups. You can filter by a site or combination of sites for further refinement.
</p>
