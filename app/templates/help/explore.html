<p align="justify">
    Welcome to the explore page. Here you can explore your annotated survey by selecting a species of interest on the menu to the right-hand side of 
    the page.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by selecting the top-level category, before progressively working through the sub-categories until you are at your desired level. If you 
    select a parent category, you will be shown all clusters labelled with that label, and its child labels.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can overwrite a cluster's label by selecting a new one using the same menu, or by using its hotkey. You can also switch between tagging levels 
    on the fly by simply choosing your desired level in the associated menu.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can also view each cluster's associated notes. A new note can be submited or existing notes can be edited or deleted for each cluster in the cluster notes textbox. You can search for clusters containing specific notes in the search textbox.
    You can also choose to view only the clusters that contain notes by selecting the appropriate checkbox.
