<p align="justify">
    Welcome to the explore page. Here you can explore your tagged survey by selecting a species of interest on the menu to the right-hand side of 
    the page.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by selecting the top-level category, before progressively working through the sub-categories until you are at your desired level. If you 
    select a parent category, you will be shown all clusters labelled with that label, and its child labels.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can overwrite a cluster's label by selecting a new one using the same menu, or by using its hotkey. You can also switch between tagging levels 
    on the fly by simply choosing your desired level in the associated menu.
