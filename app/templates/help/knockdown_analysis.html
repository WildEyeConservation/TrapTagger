    Welcome to the knockdown analysis page. Here you are able to check whether a knocked-down camera was picked up at some point during the 
    survey by a passer-by. If this is the case, this interfce helps you to quickly identify the point at which it was picked up, allowing the 
    remaining, useful images to be reclustered and tagged. If a released image is clustered into an already-tagged cluster, it automatically 
    takes on the tag allocated to that cluster, thus not requiring you to tag it. The remaining images can be manually tagged by re-launching 
    an initial-level tagging of the task.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The approach of this knockdown analysis is a little different to regular tagging. Simply determine whether each displayed image is from a knocked-down 
    camera or not, and let us do the rest. Once you have completed this process, try and launch an initial-level tagging session to determine if any clusters were 
    released for further tagging.

    Please note that pressing the undo button will undo your actions for the entire camera, as opposed to the last image, so do not be surprised 
    when the image you go back to ends up being different from the previous image.
