    Welcome to the knockdown analysis page. Here you are able to check whether a knocked-down camera was picked up at some point during the 
    survey by a passer-by. If this is the case, this interface helps you to quickly identify the point at which it was picked up, allowing the 
    remaining, useful images to be reclustered and annotated. If a released image is clustered into an already-tagged cluster, it automatically 
    takes on the label allocated to that cluster, thus not requiring you to annotate it. The remaining images can be then manually annotated in a re-launched 
    an initial-level tagging of the annotation set.

<p align="justify">
    The approach of this knockdown analysis is a little different to regular tagging. Simply determine whether each displayed image is from a knocked-down 
    camera or not, and let us do the rest. Once you have completed this process, your annotation set should be launched automatically for further annotation.

    Please note that pressing the undo button will undo your actions for the entire camera, as opposed to the last image, so do not be surprised 
    when the image you go back to ends up being different from the previous image.
