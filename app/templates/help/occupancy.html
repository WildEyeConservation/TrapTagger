    Occupancy analysis
</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Occupancy Analysis</strong> is a powerful statistical tool that allows you to gain insights from your camera trap data. This analysis helps determine the proportion of areas or sites occupied by a specific species. Key features of Occupancy Analysis include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Occupancy Probability:</strong> It calculates the likelihood of a species being present at a given site. This is essential for understanding species distribution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Detection Probability:</strong> It estimates the probability of detecting a species at a site, assuming it is present. This is useful for assessing the effectiveness of detection methods.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Covariate Effects:</strong> You can explore how various covariates impact both occupancy and detection probability, providing deeper ecological insights.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    You have the flexibility to specify the species you would like to evaluate. Additionally, you can set the observation window (sampling period) in days.
</p>

<p>
    To incorporate covariates in your analysis, click the <em>Enter Covariates</em> button, where you can input or import your covariates on a site level.
</p>

<p>
    The Occupancy Analysis is executed using an R script, which you can view by clicking the <em>View R Script</em> button. You can also download the data used in the analysis as a CSV file by clicking the <em>Download CSV</em> button. This enables further analysis or modifications using R.
</p>

<p>
    The analysis is dependent on the following R packages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unmarked/index.html">unmarked</a>: Used for occupancy model creation and probability calculations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/camtrapR/index.html">camtrapR</a>: Provides a site operation matrix used in occupancy analysis.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AICcmodavg/index.html">AICcmodavg</a>: Used for model selection based on AICc values.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html">lubridate</a>: Handles date and time calculations.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a>: Used for plotting occupancy graphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    To generate the Occupancy Analysis results, click the <em>Generate Results</em> button. Please be patient, as the analysis may take some time to complete, especially with large datasets. Avoid navigating away from the page or refreshing it during the process.
