    Occupancy analysis
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    Occupancy is a statistical analysis on your camera trap data to determine the proportion of area or sites that is occupied by a species. Occupancy analysis is based on the assumption that a species is either present or absent at a site, and that the probability of detection is less than 1. 
    Occupancy is useful for determining the occupancy probability of a species at a site, and the probability of detection of a species at a site. The analysis also allows you to view what covariates has an effect on the occupancy probability and detection probability of a species at a site.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The occupancy summary results provides the naive occupancy calculated from the number of sites where a species was detected divided by the total number of sites. It displays the best model's formula that was selected based on the AICc results.
    The AICc results can be viewed for all models that were calculated in the occupancy analysis. The best model is the model with the lowest Delta AICc. The Best Model Occupancy Simmar provides 
    the estimate summary of the best model. The best model detection summary provides the estimate summary of the best model's detection probability. Please note that the values for the occupancy and detection summary in the tables
    are in logit scale. The plots in the next tab will show the occupancy and detection probability on a regular scale.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    For the occupancy analysis a date range can be selected to limit the analysis to a specific period. The analysis can be done for multiple species at the same time. The analysis can be done for a single site or for multiple sites. The observarion window is specified in days. 
    The observation window is the number of days that is in a sampling period. To use covariates in your occupancy analysis click the <i>Enter Covariates</i> button where you can enter 
    or import your covariates on a site level.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The occupancy analysis was calculated using an R script. The script can be viewed by clicking the <i>View R Script</i> button. The data used in the analysis can be downloaded 
    as a CSV file by clicking the <i>Download CSV</i> button. A function is created in the R script where the CSV file can be loaded into R and the analysis can be done using the function if further 
    analysis is required or modifications to the analysis is needed for your own purposes.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The occupancy analysis is based on the following packages:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/unmarked/index.html">unmarked</a></li>
    <p>
        The unmarked package is used to create occupancy models and to calculate the occupancy probability and detection probability of a species at a site. The package is also used to calculate the effect of covariates on the occupancy probability and detection probability of a species at a site.
    </p>

    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/camtrapR/index.html">camtrapR</a></li>
    <p>
        The camtrapR package is used to get a site operation matrix that is used in the occupancy analysis.
    </p>

    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AICcmodavg/index.html">AICcmodavg</a></li>
    <p>
        The AICcmodavg package is used to calculate the model selection. The package is used to select the best model based on the AICc value.
    </p>
    
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html">lubridate</a></li>
    <p>
        The lubridate package is used for date and time calculations. The package is used to convert the date and time of the detections to the correct format.
    </p>
    
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a></li>
    <p>
        The ggplot2 package is used to plot the occupancy graph.
    </p>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Please click the <i>Generate Results</i> button to generate the occupancy results. Please note the occupancy results may take a while to generate. Do not 
    navigate away from the page or refreshh the page while the results are being generated.
