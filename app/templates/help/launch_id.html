    Here you can launch individual identification across surveys and annotation sets. 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Annotation Level: Select for which species you want to launch individual identification for.
        </li>
        <li>
            Surveys and Annotation Sets: Select the surveys and annotation sets you want to launch individual identification for. You must select more that one survey. Please note
            that individual identificaton on inter-cluster level have to be completed for the surveys and annotation sets you select.
        </li>
        <li>
            Batch size: Specify the batch size for your identification job. The batch size is the number of clusters that will be processed at a time.
        </li>
        <li>
            Identification stage: You can select inter-cluster or exhaustive identification. Inter-cluster identification allows you to identify individuals across individuals based on
            their calculated similarity down to a pre-defined threshold. Exhausive identification allows you to identify individuals with no threshold.
        </li>
        <li>
            Algorithm: Select the algorithm you want to use for individual identification. You can select from the following algorithms: Hotspotter or Heuristic Only.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Once the identification job has been launched, you can view the job in the Jobs section. After the job has finished preparing you can take the job on the jobs page.
