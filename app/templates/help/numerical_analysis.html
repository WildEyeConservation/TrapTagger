<h4>Numerical Analysis/h4>

<!--TODO: Update help page for NUMERICAL ANALYSIS-->
<p align="justify">
    Finally, the numerical analysis allows you to view the sightings in a simple bar-graph format, allowing you to either compare total sighting numbers for a number of species, 
    or to compare the sightings of those species as a function of your sites. The selection between these can be achieved with the comparison drop down menu, by selecting 
    survey counts and site counts respectively. Again, you have the option to perform the comparison using either image counts, or cluster counts using the associated drop-down menu.  
    You also have the option to normalise the counts relative to the total count for that species should you perform a trap-count analysis. As before, this allows you to compare the relative distributions 
    of species with widely varying numbers.
