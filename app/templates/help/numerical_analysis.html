<h4>Numerical Analysis</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Numerical Analysis</strong> feature provides valuable insights into species counts on a site-level basis, enabling you to gain a comprehensive understanding of your species data.
</p>

<p>
    Here's what you can do with Numerical Analysis:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Data Unit Selection:</strong> You can specify the data unit for analysis, choosing from cluster, image, sightings, or a custom <em>x</em> time to independence level. This flexibility allows you to tailor the analysis to your specific needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Comparison:</strong> You can compare the total counts of each species or compare on a site-level basis. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Species Selection:</strong> Select one or more species for analysis, providing a comprehensive view of species counts for the chosen species.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Relative Abundance Index:</strong> Optionally, normalise the counts by site effort days to calculate the Relative Abundance Index (RAI). This allows you to compare species distribution across sites with different operational periods.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Once you've configured your analysis, you can export the chart as a PNG image by clicking the <em>Export</em> button. Customize the chart's appearance using <em>Chart Options</em> to ensure it's displayed exactly as you need it. For more detailed information, hover over the chart to access additional insights.
