<p> 
    Here you can give detailed access permissions to a user in your organisation on a per survey basis. Select a survey from the dropdown menu, then select the level of access you would 
    like to give the user and select whether you would like to give them access to annotation jobs. A user can have multiple detailed permissions. Please ensure you select unique surveys. 
    The detailed access for a user will override the default access permissions for the organisation.
