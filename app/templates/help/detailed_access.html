<p> 
    Here you can setup permission exceptions for a user in your organisation on a per-survey basis, overriding their default access permissions for the organisation. 
    Select a survey from the dropdown menu, then select the level of access you would 
    like to give the user. Additionally select whether you would like to give them access to annotation jobs for that survey. A user can have multiple permission exceptions. Please ensure you select unique surveys.
