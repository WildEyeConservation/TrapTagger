    Here you can download your dataset with all the annotated information, including altered timestamps, contained in the file data. Additionally, you can have your files sorted by 
    species or individuals.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Importantly, the downloader will try synchronise the destination folder with your data, based on the contents of the files themselves (as opposed to their file names). This means that 
    if you select your destination folder as the local top-level folder 
    that contains the files of your survey, the downloader will find the files locally, label their EXIF data or metadata and sort them into folders according to your desired download, without having 
    to download anything. Any files that do not exist in the destination folder will then be downloaded.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    This also means that a download can be stopped at any time, and simply resumed by restarting the download with the same destination folder - the downloader will automatically detect 
    which images are already there and only download the remaining images.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Also note that you have the option as to whether the downloader should delete anything. If set to delete, it will delete any files or folders that shouldn't be there. In comparison, if 
    you set it to not delete anything, it will simply copy or download any desired files to their new location, leaving the original in place along with any other unexpected images or files. This means that, 
    for example, if you select a species-sorted download, with no deletion, and select your local folder of survey images, the downloader will copy your local 
    files into a number of top-level species folders without changing your original data, or downloading anything.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Alternatively, if you select a download with the original folder structre, with deletion, and empty files exlcuded, the downloader will EXIF-label all of your local files, and delete the 
    empty files for you without downloading anything.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Otherwise it can simply download everything into a new destination folder if that is what you would prefer.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    In general, the various options should be fairly self-explanatory, but here is a summary:
</div>

<ul>
    <li>
        Filter the dataset for specific species of interest.
    </li>
    <li>
        Either retain the oiginal folder structue in which you uploaded the data, or collapse the files into a single folder with all site, timestamp and label information in the file name.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the data sorted into separate top-level folders by species.
    </li>
    <li>
        Have the data sorted into separate folders for each individual, where possible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include or exclude the empty files.
    </li>
    <li>
        Delete or retain the unexpected files and folders found in the destination folder.
    </li>
    <li>
        Download video content as extracted frames, video files or both.
    </li>
    <li>
        Files in compressed or raw format. The downloader will always look for local files first, and only download the files that are missing as either compressed or raw files.
    </li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Please note that due to security limitations, the downloader will only work with Chromium-based internet browsers such as Google Chrome.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you would like to download raw files, empty files or video content, a 48-hour wait period is required to allow the files to be restored from our 
    archival storage. The download will become available after this period. Also note that empty files and videos are only available for download in compressed format.
