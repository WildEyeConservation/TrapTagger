    Here you can create a new survey. Let us begin with some background information:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A survey is just a set of images. You can separate your data along any line you wish, be that be a survey per year, or per month, or per season.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can always add additional images to a survey at any time.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no limit on survey size, but it is recommended that you keep your survey size to under 300 000 images to expeience best peformance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Images within a survey are broken down into sites and cameras, where you can have multiple cameras per site.
    </li>
    <li>
        For efficiency, sites and cameras are automatically defined according to the folder structure of the images you upload since images are typically stored in 
        a folder structure with a folder per site, and a folder per camera within that.
    </li>
    <li>
        Timestamps will be extracted directly from your image exif data. Whilst site coordinates can be added in the edit survey window.
    </li>
</ul>
    
<h4>Survey Name and Description</h4>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by giving your new survey a unique name, and an optional description.
</p>

<h4>Image Upload</h4>

<p align="justify">
    Thereafter you need to specify which images should be pocessed and associated with this survey. 
    Your images for the survey can be uploaded in two ways:
</p>

<div align="justify">
    1. Bucket Upload (Recommended)
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    <i>This is the recommended option due to it's robust nature and its ability to allow for the pausing/resumption 
    of uploads and the ability to sync folders etc.</i>
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    <i>All images are guaranteed to be uploaded.</i>
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    <i>It is required for larger sets of images.</i>
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px"> 
    In this appoach you first upload the images directly to our cloud storage using a third-party application such as 
    <a href='https://cyberduck.io/'>CyberDuck</a> before creating a survey here. Once the upload is complete, you simply need to select the name of the folder containing the images in 
    the folder name drop-down menu to indicate which images must be imported.
</div>
<br>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    Detailed instructions for using CyberDuck are as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>Download and install the software</li>
        <li>Open the software</li>
        <li>Click Bookmark -> New Bookmark</li>
        <li>Select Amazon S3 in the drop down menu at the top of the form</li>
        <li>Choose a bookmark nickname if you like</li>
        <li>Fill in your Access Key ID</li>
        <li>Fill in your Secret Access Key</li>
        <li>Click on the 'More Options' arrow</li>
        <li>Set the path to your folder name</li>
        <li>Close the form</li>
        <li>Open the bookmark by double clicking on it</li>
        <li>Upload a folder by dragging it into the application</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div align="justify">
    2. Browser Upload
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    <i>This approach is only suitable for small numbers of images, and good internet connections.</i>
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    <i>Some images may be dropped.</i>
</div>
<div align="justify" style="padding-left:20px">
    Upload the images directly through your internet browser by selecting a folder of images to upload using the 'add images' button. 
    The upload will commence when you press the create button, thereafter the images will be automatically imported upon upload completion.
</div>
<br>

<h4>Site Identifier</h4>

<p align="justify">
    Thereafter, you must specify a site identifier. This is used to determine which folders within your folder structure relate to your camera sites.
    By default, the system will look for folders that contain your specified string of characters along with any number of digits thereafter.
    The simplest example of this would be:
</p>

<div align="justify">
    SurveyName/Site01/camera1/
</div>
<div align="justify">
    SurveyName/Site01/camera2/
</div>
<div align="justify">
    SurveyName/Site02/camera1/
</div>
<div align="justify">
    SurveyName/Site02/camera2/
</div>
<br>
    
<p align="justify">    
    where a site identifier of the word "Site" would identify the folders "Site01", and "Site02" as containing 
    all the images from sites 1, and 2 respectively. On the other hand, cameras are simply defined as the lowest-level folders. Do not worry though if your bottom-level 
    folders do not correlate to cameras as their definition will not affect system performance.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    These folder names can occur multiple times within the folder structure without issue if you have your data split by month, 
    for example. However, please note that if you identifier matches multiple folders in the path for a single image, the first match is used, so ensure that it will not 
    match with your top-level folder name, for example.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Should your site-naming convention differ from this schema, you can use the advanced option to specify a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_regex.asp"> 
    regular expression</a> - a type of programmable search query. Use the built-in regular-expression builder to build up your site identifier.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Either way, the system will check your specified site identifier against the folder of images that you are importing, and report back both the number of sites identified,
    and their names. Use this information to ensure that you have specified the correct site identifier for your data.
