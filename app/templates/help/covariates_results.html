<h4>Occupancy Results</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Occupancy Results</strong> are presented in the form of two graphs and prediction tables. The content and number of graphs depend on the best occupancy model used:
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Null Model:</strong> If the best occupancy model is the Null model, meaning no covariates are used, you'll see two graphs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Occupancy Probability on a Site Level:</strong> This graph displays the probability that a species is present at each site.</li>
    <li><strong>Detection Probability on a Site Level:</strong> This graph shows the probability that a species is detected at each site, given that it is present.</li>
    <li><strong>Prediction Table:</strong> This table displays the predicted occupancy and detection probability for each site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Model with Covariates:</strong> If the best occupancy model includes covariates in the formula, two sets of graphs will be displayed for each covariate:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Predicted Occupancy/Detection Probability on a Site Level for Covariates:</strong> This graph illustrates the predicted occupancy or detection probability at each site based on the covariate values for those sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Occupancy/Detection Probability as a Function of the Covariate:</strong> This graph depicts how the occupancy or detection probability changes as the covariate values vary.</li>
    <li><strong>Prediction Table:</strong> This table displays the predicted occupancy or detection probability for each site.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Occupancy Probability:</strong> This represents the probability that a species is present at a given site.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Detection Probability:</strong> This is the probability that a species is detected at a site, given that it is present.

    You can export the graphs as images by selecting the <em>Export</em> button. You can copy the data from the <em>Prediction Table</em> by selecting the clipboard icon.
