<h4>Occupancy Results</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The occupancy results are presented in the form of two graphs. If the best occupancy model is the Null model meaning there are no covariates used in the model then the two graphs
    shown are your occupancy probability on a site level and your detection probability on a site level. If the best occupancy model includes covariates in the formula, tow graphs will
    be shown for each covariate. The first graph will show the predicted occupancy/detection probablity on a site level for the covariates for the sites. The next graph will show
    the occupancy/detection probabilty as a function of the covariate. Occupancy probabilty is the probability that a species is present at a site. Detection probability is the probability
    that a species is detected at a site given that it is present. The graphs can be exported as an image by selecting the <i>Export</i> button.

    Please click the <i>Generate Results</i> button to generate the occupancy results. Please note the occupancy results may take a while to generate. Do not 
    navigate away from the page or refreshh the page while the results are being generated.
