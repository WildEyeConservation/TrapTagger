<h4>Activity Pattern</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Activity Pattern Analysis</strong> is a statistical tool used to determine the activity pattern of a species within a 24-hour period. It's based on the number of detections per hour of the day and is particularly useful for understanding when species are active. Multiple species can be selected to visualize how their activity patterns overlap.
</p>

<p>
    Key features of the Activity Pattern Analysis include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Multiple Species:</strong> You can analyze the activity patterns of multiple species simultaneously, with the option to estimate overlap between two species.</li>
    <li><strong>Axis Centering:</strong> Choose to center the graph axis around midday or midnight, depending on your preference.</li>
    <li><strong>Result Types:</strong> You can view results as either the frequency of species detections or the density of detections.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Reference:</strong> The analysis can be conducted using either solar time (based on average location) or clock time (based on time of day).</li>
    <li><strong>Export Graph:</strong> You can export the Activity Pattern graph as a PNG file by clicking the <em>Export</em> button.</li>
    <li><strong>Script and Data:</strong> Access the underlying R script by clicking <em>View R Script</em>, and download the data used in the analysis as a CSV file by clicking <em>Download CSV</em>. This allows for further analysis or customization of the script.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Activity Pattern Analysis relies on the following R packages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/activity/index.html">activity</a>: Used to calculate the activity pattern of species by estimating their activity level per hour of the day.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/overlap/index.html">overlap</a>: Used to calculate overlap between two species, providing an overlap coefficient based on their activity patterns.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/index.html">lubridate</a>: Employed for date and time calculations, ensuring that detection date and time are in the correct format.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/solartime/index.html">solartime</a>: Utilized to calculate sunrise and sunset times based on the average location of detection sites.</li>
    <li><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html">ggplot2</a>: Used for creating the Activity Pattern graph.</li>
</ul>

    To generate Activity Pattern results, click the <em>Generate Results</em> button. Please note that the analysis may take some time to complete. Do not navigate away from the page or refresh it while the results are being generated.
