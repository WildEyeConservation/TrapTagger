    Diversity Indices
</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Diversity Indices</strong> provide valuable metrics to measure the diversity of species within a specific area. These indices help researchers and ecologists understand the complexity and variety of species in a community. Here are the key diversity indices calculated:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Shannon-Wiener Index:</strong>
        <p>
            The Shannon-Wiener Index quantifies species diversity by considering the proportion of each species in the community. It is calculated using the formula:
        </p>
        <p align="center">

        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Simpson's Index (D):</strong>
        <p>
            Simpson's Index measures species diversity, taking into account both the number of individuals per species and the total number of individuals in the community. The formula is:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D&space;=&space;\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{S}&space;n_{i}&space;(n_{i}-1)}{N(N-1)}" title="D = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{S} n_{i} (n_{i}-1)}{N(N-1)}" style="background-color:white; padding: 2px" />
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Simpson's Index of Diversity (1-D):</strong>
        <p>
            This index complements Simpson's Index, with the formula 1-D.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Hill Number (q=2):</strong>
        <p>
            The Hill Number with q=2 is calculated as 1/D, where D represents Simpson's Index.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Pielou's Evenness:</strong>
        <p>
            Pielou's Evenness measures how evenly species are distributed in a community. It is calculated using the formula:
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?J&space;=&space;\frac{H}{ln(S)}" title="J = \frac{H}{ln(S)}" style="background-color:white; padding: 2px" />
        </p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Species Richness:</strong>
        <p>
            Species Richness represents the total number of species in the community, calculated as the sum of the proportions of each species.
        </p>
        <p align="center">
            <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?S&space;=&space;\sum_{i=1}^{S}&space;p_{i}" title="S = \sum_{i=1}^{S} p_{i}" style="background-color:white; padding: 2px" />
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The Diversity Indices summary is a valuable tool for assessing species diversity in your data. The data unit selected is used to calculate the proportions of each species in the community.
