    Here you can view all the sightings that have been marked as unidentifiable. If you wish to remove the unidentifiable status from a sighting, you can do 
    so by selecting the sighting and clicking the "Restore Sighting" button. This will create a new individual for the sighting, allowing you to reassign it to an existing individual if desired.
