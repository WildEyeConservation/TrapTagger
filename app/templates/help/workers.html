    Welcome to the worker management page. Here you can manage what accounts have permission to annotate your data. You will see all accounts with 
    permission listed here along with a number of statistics for each, including your admin account (although you cannot block youself from annotating 
    your own data).
</p>

<div align="justify">
    You can perform three actions here:
</div>

<ul>
    <li>You can invite more workers to annotate for you using the invite button.</li>
    <li>You can revoke permission for a worker using the remove button.</li>
    <li>You view more details about a worker with the details button.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Note that if you have some students/interns/workers that you would like to annotate for you, you must ask them to first sign up for a worker 
    account through the website's login page. Thereafter, can you invite them to annotate for you here.
