    Welcome to TrapTagger! For you to have access to surveys and annotation jobs, an organisation administrator must invite you to join their organisation or you can register a new organisation by clicking <a href="{{ url_for('TTRegisterAdmin') + '?logout=true' }}">here</a>.
    The invitation will appear in your notifications which you can access by clicking on the bell icon in the top right corner of the page. To accept the invitation, click on the 'Accept' link. 
    Once you have accepted the invitation, you will have access to the organisation's surveys and annotation jobs according to your permissions.
