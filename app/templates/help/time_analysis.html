<h4>Time Analysis</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The time analysis chart provides you with species counts as a function of time. The time analysis chart can be used to view how your species sightings
    increase or decrease over time. The species counts can be viewed as a function of <i>x</i> days, months or years. A date range can be selected to
    view the species counts for a specific time period. In this analysis, it is recommended that you select a date range but it is not required. The displayed counts are determined
    by the species, site, and data unit (clusters/images/sightings/time to independence) you have selected. A trendline can be added to the chart to view the overall trend of your species counts.
