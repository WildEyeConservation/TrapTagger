    Welcome to the second stage of the individual identification pipeline. Here you are allocated an individual in your left-hand panel (along with all images associated with it), 
    and subsequently offered suggestions of possibly matching individuals one-at-a-time in the right-hand panel (along with all images associated with it). 
    Your task is to determine if the suggested individual is the same as your allocated individual. If it is, simply <b>accept</b> the 
    suggestion using the associated button, or by pressing the <b>space</b> bar. The images of the accepted suggestion will then be moved across to your allocated individual, 
    and a new suggestion offered. Alternatively, if the suggested match is not the same as your allocated individual, <b>reject</b> the suggestion by clicking the button, or 
    by pressing <b>r</b>. As you add images to your allocated individual, your reference material will grow, allowing the system to find you even more potential matches. 
    Once the system has run out of suggested matches, you will be allocated a new individual to match.                    
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you are unsure whether a suggested individual is the same as your allocated individual, <b>skip</b> it. That pairing will then removed until the task is 
    launched again, when somebody else can look at it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you have made a mistake, use the <b>undo</b> button to undo your last action.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you notice a sighting that has been incorrectly associated with either of the two individuals, you can <b>dissociate</b> it from that individual by right-clicking 
    it and selecting the associated option. It will then be moved to its own individual, and subsequently offered as a suggestion for other individuals.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If the individual you have been allocated is too challenging to match due to its lack of images, or the quality thereof, you can move on to the <b>next individual</b> by using the 
    associated button or hotkey. That individual will then be allocated to you or someone else at a later stage when it hopefully has had more images associated with it.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Lastly, if you have been suggested an individual with images that are of too poor quality to match with any other individual, you can discard that suggested individual 
    by marking it as <b>unidentifiable</b>.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    To assist in identifying individuals, you can view a heatmap of the matching features between the two sightings by clicking on the <b>Matching Features Heatmap</b> 
    button or pressing the <b>h</b> key. Please note that matching features are available only for sightings of the same flank and only if you used the Hotspotter algorithm in 
    the previous stage. You can also adjust the opacity and size of the heatmap points for better visualization.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    For more information about the current individual, you can open a side panel by clicking on the &#9776; button in the top left or right corner of the screen.
    This panel will show you the name, notes, tags, sites, and primary images of the individual, as well as the associated features. You have the ability
    to edit the name, notes, and tags of the individual in this panel. Clicking on the primary images will open them in a new tab, allowing you to view them in more detail as well
    as to select a different primary images or add/edit features on them.
</p>
