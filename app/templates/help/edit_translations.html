    Here you are required to update your classification translations before launching an annotation set for annotation. This is normally required after updating the classifier version on a 
    survey, or after editing the labels on a survey. These translations are used 
    to translate between your chosen annotation set labels, and the classifications generated by our AI model and are used for auto-classification, image ordering within a 
    cluster, and classification comparisons.

<p align="justify">
    Where possible, the translations have been automatically generated for you. However, where we have not been able to identify a similar label, you must 
    stipulate the translation manually.
