    Here you can edit your existing labels, add new ones, and alter the hierarchical structure for the selected annotation set.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by selecting the level in the hierarchical structure that you would like to edit in the label level selector. Next, you can make your desired changes by simply 
    editing the associated box, or by adding labels to the selected level. You must then add those changes into the current session before moving onto another level. 
    This will not only stop those changes from being lost, but also allow the new labels to appear in your hierarchy. You 
    will then be able to add child labels to your new label as needed. Once you have made all the changes you would like to make, you must save them in order for them 
    to take effect. If you do not, all changes in the current session that have not been saved, will be discarded.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you edit an already-existing label that has been used to annotate clusters, the label will still be associated with those clusters. It will simply just take on the new name. 
    This means you can edit the name of a species to correct a spelling mistake, or change between a common name and a scientific one etc.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can add a label to an already-tagged category and then relaunch it to see the skipped clusters and tag them with the new labels as needed.
</p>

    A final use case would be if you only expected one subspecies eg. white rhino, and end up encountering a black rhino. You can instruct your workers to tag them all as white rhino 
    and then edit that label to simply be rhinoceros, and then add both black and white rhino as children of that. You can then simply launch the rhinoceros category and sort though 
    the two.
