<h4> Spatial Captures</h4>

<p>
    <strong>Spatial Captures</strong> are visualized in a graph, providing insights into the spatial distribution of individuals. These capture locations play a crucial role in spatial capture-recapture analysis.
    In the graph, circles represent the average spatial location of individual captures, while crosses mark the site locations. Lines connect sites visited by the individual (in cases where an individual is detected at multiple sites).
    You can export this graph as an image by clicking the <em>Export</em> button.
