    Here you can get a clearer picture of the status of your task - you can see the number of clusters, images, and detections associated with each of your labels. A cluster 
    is a cluster of images constituting a single sighting of a group of animals, whilst the image count is the count of images contained within those clusters. On the other hand,
    the detection count is the number of animals detected across those images and clusters. Note that empty images can be clustered with images containing sightings, so it is possible 
    there to be more images than detections for species that tend to be more solitary.

    Next, the count and percentage of those detections that has been manually checked is presented. Every single species does not need to be checked but it is necessary for precise results. 
    Note that you cannot begin checking detections until you have finished tagging all the labels in your hierarchy.

    Lastly, the tagged and completion status are presented for the parent labels. These are fairly self-explantory. The tagged status indicates whether that category has been 
    tagged at some point, whereas the completion status indicates whether that categorey has been tagged to completion. If images were skipped in that category, or it was 
    stopped prematurely, then it will tagged, but incomplete.
