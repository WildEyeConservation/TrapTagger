    Here you can get a clearer picture of the status of your annotation set to determine what has been annotated, and what hasn't. This information is broken down and presented for 
    each label in the annotation set, where labels are hidden under their parent categories for ease of reading (click on a category to open it). The information is broken down 
    as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Summary: Here the counts of the clusters, images, sightings and individuals are presented for each label.
    </li>

    <li>
        Species Annotation: Here the progress of your species annotation is indicated. The tagged column indicates whether a category has been annotated, whilst the complete 
        column indicates whether that particular category has been annotated to completion. If, for example, you annotate the antelope category and skip some antelope clusters 
        (essentially leaving them as unknown antelope), that label will be indicated as tagged, but not complete. You would need to annotate those unknown antelope for the 
        status of the category to change to complete.
    </li>

    <li>
        AI Check: Here you can see whether the AI check has been performed for this annotation set along with the number of clusters of a particlar label maybe be mislabeled as another 
        label.
    </li>

    <li>
        Informational Tagging: Indicates whether information tagging has been performed for the particular label.
    </li>
    
    <li>
        Sighting Correction: Indicates the number of sightings that have been checked and the associated percentage for a particular label.
    </li>

    <li>
        Individual ID: Indicates whether each level of individual ID has been performed for a particular label.
    </li>
</ul>
