    There are a number of ways to examine you annotation set: explore the survey, an Excel file, a comparison between tasks, a CSV file, statistical tools, 
    an identikit of identified individuals, download metadata-annotated images, and export.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Explore allows you to view all the clusters tagged with a particular label. There is also the option to set the tagging level to any level on the fly, 
    allowing you to re-label any cluster easily. In particular, this is very helpful for re-examining the clusters tagged as unknown.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Statistical tools provides a number of graphical analysis tools for visualising your data.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Individuals allows you to explore and edit your identified individuals for the annotation set.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The fourth option allows you to either generate your own custom csv file, or download a pre-fomatted one (if you click the download option). These files can then be imported 
    into third-party software for analysis (such as Excel).
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Image download allows you to download your dataset as sorted metadata-annotated images.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Another option is to download a nicely-formatted Excel file summary of your entire survey.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Comparison allows you to set up a comparison with another annotation set from the same survey. This is useful in comparing different versions of the AI, or comparing the AI's results 
    to some manually-tagged results.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Export allows you to download your data in formats that can be directly imported into other software.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Please note that the results files may take a while to generate, especially for larger surveys. You can queue up a single CSV, and a single Excel file for any number of tasks, 
    and they will be downloaded when ready. However, if you request multiple CSV files for a single task, you will only recieve that last file format you requested.
