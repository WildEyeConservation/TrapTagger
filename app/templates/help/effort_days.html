    Camera Trap Effort Days
</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Effort Days Summary</strong> serves to calculate the number of days that each camera trap was active during a specific period. This count is derived from identifying the unique days on which images were captured by each camera trap.
</p>

<p>
    This summary is particularly helpful for gaining insights into camera trap activity patterns. You can use it to determine:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The active duration of each camera trap.</li>
    <li>Which camera traps were operational during a specific time frame.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You can categorize the camera traps as either a site, camera, or site group for tailored analysis. 
</p>
