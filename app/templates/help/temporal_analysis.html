    Temporal Analysis
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The temporal analysis displays the total count for each selected data combination (species and site) as a function of time of day. This can be used to 
    identify the time of day when a species is most active. Multiple data combinations can be added so that the temporal analysis can be used to
    compare the activity patterns of different species.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The temporal analysis can be modified by changing the data unit, the date range, normalisation, and the data combination. The data combination is 
    the species and site combination that is being analysed. The chart type can be modified to display the data as the type of chart that is most
    appropriate for the data. The chart can be downloaded as a PNG image by clicking the <i>Export</i> button. The chart display can be modified in
    <i>Chart Options</i> to how you would like it do be displayed when exported.
