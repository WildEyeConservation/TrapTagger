    Welcome to the statistical analysis page. Here you can perform three types of analysis: temporal, spatial and numerical.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The temporal analysis is a time-based analysis of your survey, allowing you to view species sightings as a function of time of day. This in turn allows you to 
    determine the activity of the animal populations within the park. Further, you have the ability to view this information as a function of your camera traps, allowing you to 
    potentially find patterns of movement within the reserve. Use the normalisation ability to allow for comparisons between species with large numerical descrepancies, 
    by normalising all counts for an entry by its total number of sighings. You can also switch between seeing the statistics on an image, or a cluster level. A cluster is 
    a cluster of images constituting a single sighting, which can prevent the distortion effect caused by a herd milling about in front of a camera.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The spatial analysis is a space-based analysis of your survey, where you can view species sightings as a function of space, which in turn allows you to determine which areas 
    or biomes contain more or less of a particular species. Again, you have the ability to view this data on either an image or cluster level. Further, you have the option 
    to normalise the heatmap by the trap density across the reserve. This helps reduce the biasing effect of there being more sightings in areas with more cameras. The radius parameter 
    allows you to change the radius thrown by each trap in the heatmap, essentially changing the size of the area averaged, which can help illuminate different patterns. Note that 
    on the top right-hand corner of the map, you have the ability to switch between different maps: a selection of Google-owned and open-source satellite and street maps. Finally, should you wish to 
    see a heatmap for all species in the park, you have the option to exclude empty images, knocked down cameras, and images containing vehicles, humans, and livestock. This allows 
    you to actually see the heatmap for the animals in the reserve.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Finally, the numerical analysis allows you to view the sightings in a simple bar-graph format, allowing you to either compare total sighting numbers for a number of species, 
    or to compare the sightings of those species as a function of your camera traps. The selection between these can be achieved with the comparison drop down menu, by selecting 
    survey counts and site counts respectively. Again, you have the option to perform the comparison using either image counts, or cluster counts using the associated drop-down menu.  
    You also have the option to normalise the counts relative to the total count for that species should you perform a trap-count analysis. As before, this allows you to compare the relative distributions 
    of species with widely varying numbers.

    <i>Note that you are able to obtain extra information by mousing over the graphs and maps. In the case of graphs, you will be shown the count associated with a column, whilst 
        for a map you will be shown the name of the trapgroup.
