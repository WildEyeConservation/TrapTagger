<p align="justify">
    Welcome to the analysis page. Here you will be able to apply different analysis to your data. 
</p>

<h4 align="justify">
    Analysis Options
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The analysis options are where you can select which analysis you would like to apply to your data and all the associated parameters. You can specify parameters such as which species to include in the analysis,
    which sites to include, what date range to include, what data unit and any other parameters that are required for the analysis.
    The following analysis are available:
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>1. Summary Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The summary analysis will provide you with a summary of the data in your survey. You will get a general data summary as well as diversity , abundance and camera trap statistics.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>2. Temporal Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The temporal analysis will provide you with a temporal analysis of your data for particular species and site combinations. Temporal analysis allows you to view what time of the day a particular species is active at a particular site. 
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>3. Spatial Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The spatial analysis will provide you with a spatial analysis of your data. YThe spatial analyis provides a heatmap of your species counts at each site. You can select which species and sites you would like to include in your spatial analysis.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>4. Numerical Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The numerical analysis will provide you with site or survey based counts of your data. It will provide you with species counts of a site or survey basis.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>5. Time Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The time analysis will provide you with a time analysis of your data. The time analysis allows you to view your species counts as a function of time. You can select which species and sites you would like to include in your time analysis.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>6. Activity Pattern Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The activity pattern analysis will provide you with an activity pattern analysis of your data. It will provide you with density plots of your species as a function of time of day.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>7. Occupancy Analysis</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The occupancy analysis will provide you with an occupancy analysis of your data. It will provide you with occupancy and detection probabilities for your species at each site.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    <i>8. Spatial Capture-Recapture</i>
</div>

<p align="justify">
    The spatial capture-recapture analysis will provide you with a spatial capture-recapture analysis of your data. It will provide density, abundance, and detection probability estimates for your species based on your identified individuals.
</p>


<h4 align="justify">
    Chart Options
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The chart options are where you can select how your charts will be displayed. You can select background, font, axis and border colours, as well as whether to include certain elements such as a legend, gridlines, and a title in your chart. 
    If you export your charts, the chart will be exported with the selected options. The chart options will be saved for the current analysis session (i.e. if you refresh the page, the chart options will be reset). Please note that only certain
    chart types will allow you to select certain options. 
</p>

<h4 align="justify">
    Task Selection
</h4>

<p align="justify">
    The task selection is where you can select which annotation sets should be used for your surveys in the analysis. By default it uses the first annotation set for each survey. To 
    save your task selection, click the save button. The task selection will be saved only for the current analysis session (i.e. if you refresh the page, the task selection will be reset).
