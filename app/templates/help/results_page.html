<p>
    Welcome to the Analysis page. Here, you can apply various analyses to your data and customize their parameters to gain insights from your survey.
</p>

<h4>Datasets</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Datasets</strong> section allows you to select the datasets you want to analyze. You have the option to select 'All' surveys. If you have selected 'All' surveys,
    you have to specify which annotation set to use for surveys that have multiple annotation sets. You can also select specific surveys and annotation sets.
</p>

<p> A date range filter can be specified to use across all analyses. Please note if no date range is specified, the full date range of the selected surveys will be used. </p>


<h4>Sites</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Sites</strong> section allows you to select the sites you want to analyze. You have the option to select 'All' sites or specific sites. You can select sites using the following
    methods:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Search:</strong> Search for sites by name or use the advanced search to search by regular expression. Once you have found the sites you want to select, click 'Select All' or select individual sites.</li>
    <li><strong>Select on Map:</strong> Select sites by drawing a polygon on the map. Once you have drawn the polygon, click 'Save' to select the sites within the polygon.</li>
    <li><strong>Load from Group:</strong> Select sites from a previously saved site group. Click 'Load Groups' to view your saved site groups and select the group you want to use.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The sites that will be used in the analyses will appear in the 'Sites' section. Only the checked sites will be used. You can uncheck sites to remove them from the analyses.
    If you wish you can create a new site group from the selected sites by clicking 'Save Sites as Group'. 
</p>


<h4>Analysis</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Analysis</strong> section allows you to choose from different analyses and configure their parameters. You can specify the species, sites, date range, data unit, and other necessary settings for each analysis. The following analyses are available:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Summary Analysis</strong>: Provides a general data summary along with diversity, abundance, and camera trap statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporal Analysis</strong>: Offers insights into species activity patterns over time for specific species and site combinations.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong>: Generates a heatmap of species counts at each site, allowing species and site selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Numerical Analysis</strong>: Provides site or survey-based species counts.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong>: Analyzes species counts as a function of time, with species and site selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Activity Pattern Analysis</strong>: Presents density plots of species over time of day.</li>
    <li><strong>Occupancy Analysis</strong>: Calculates occupancy and detection probabilities for species at each site.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Capture-Recapture</strong>: Estimations of density, abundance, and detection probabilities based on identified individuals.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Chart</h4>

<p>
    In the <strong>Chart</strong> section, you can customize how your charts are displayed. Configure background colours, font colours, axis colours, borders, legends, and gridlines for your charts. Your selected chart options will be applied when exporting the charts. Note that specific chart types may have limitations on certain options.
