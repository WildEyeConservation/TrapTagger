    Welcome to the Analysis page. Here, you can apply various analyses to your data and customize their parameters to gain insights from your survey.
</p>

<h4>Analysis Options</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Analysis Options</strong> section allows you to choose from different analyses and configure their parameters. You can specify the species, sites, date range, data unit, and other necessary settings for each analysis. The following analyses are available:
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Summary Analysis</strong>: Provides a general data summary along with diversity, abundance, and camera trap statistics.</li>
    <li><strong>Temporal Analysis</strong>: Offers insights into species activity patterns over time for specific species and site combinations.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong>: Generates a heatmap of species counts at each site, allowing species and site selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Numerical Analysis</strong>: Provides site or survey-based species counts.</li>
    <li><strong>Time Analysis</strong>: Analyzes species counts as a function of time, with species and site selection.</li>
    <li><strong>Activity Pattern Analysis</strong>: Presents density plots of species over time of day.</li>
    <li><strong>Occupancy Analysis</strong>: Calculates occupancy and detection probabilities for species at each site.</li>
    <li><strong>Spatial Capture-Recapture</strong>: Estimations of density, abundance, and detection probabilities based on identified individuals.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Chart Options</h4>

<p>
    In the <strong>Chart Options</strong> section, you can customize how your charts are displayed. Configure background colours, font colours, axis colours, borders, legends, and gridlines for your charts. Your selected chart options will be applied when exporting the charts. Note that specific chart types may have limitations on certain options.
</p>

<h4>Task Selection</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>Task Selection</strong> section allows you to choose which annotation sets should be used for your surveys in the analysis. By default, the first annotation set for each survey is selected. To save your task selection, click the "Save" button. Please note that the task selection will be saved only for the current analysis session, and it will reset if you refresh the page.
