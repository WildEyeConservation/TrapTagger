    Here you are able to manage the files in your survey.
</div>

<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        Add Files: Add files (images and/or videos) to your already-existing survey. This can be in the form of a new camera, new site, or even missing files from the initial upload. Any duplicate 
        files will be ignored, and the new files seamlessly imported to your survey. As before you can upload the new files through your browser.
    </li>

    <li>
        Edit Files: Delete folders or files that you no longer want in your survey. You can also move folders to different sites. You can rename sites or cameras as needed.
    </li>

</ul>
