    Here you are able to add files (images and/or videos) to your already-existing survey. This can be in the form of a new camera, new trapgroup, or even missing files from the initial upload. Any duplicate 
    files will be ignored, and the new files seamlessly imported to your survey. As before you can upload the new files through your browser.
