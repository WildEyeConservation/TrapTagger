    Here you are able to manage the files in your survey.
</div>

<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        <strong>Add Files</strong>: Add files (images and/or videos) to your already-existing survey. This can be in the form of a new camera, new site, or even missing files from the initial upload. Any duplicate 
        files will be ignored, and the new files seamlessly imported to your survey. As before you can upload the new files through your browser.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Edit Files</strong>: View and manage your survey structure. From this section, you can:
        <ul>
            <li><i class="fa fa-folder-open"></i> Expand folders to view their contents and select individual files for deletion.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-trash-can"></i> Delete folders that are no longer needed in your survey.</li>
            <li><i class="fa fa-arrows-up-down-left-right"></i> Move folders between sites and cameras.</li>
            <li>Rename sites or cameras by clicking directly on their names.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>
