    Here you can invite workers to annotate for you by entering the email address associated with their account. They will then be sent an email 
    confiming whether they would like to annotate for you. If they follow the link in that email, they will then be able to see your launched 
    jobs. Just ensure that they have an account before inviting them - they can find the signup form for a worker account on the login page.
