    Here you can invite users to join an organisation by entering their email address associated with their account as well as selecting the 
    organisation you would like to invite them to. They will then be sent a notification confirming whether they would like to join the organisation.
    After they have accepted the invitation, you will be able to give them access to surveys and annotation jobs. Their access permissions will be
    set to the lowest level of access for the organisation by default so you will need to update their permissions after they have accepted to your own 
    requirements. Just ensure that they have an account before inviting them - they can find the signup form for a user account on the login page.
