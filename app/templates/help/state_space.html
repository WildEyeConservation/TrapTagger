<h4> State Space</h4>

<p>
    The <strong>State Space</strong> results in a graph that visually represents the state space utilized in the spatial capture-recapture analysis. This state space is essential for understanding the spatial distribution of individuals within your study area. 
    If you have selected to mask your study area, a border will be displayed on the graph to indicate the masked area.
