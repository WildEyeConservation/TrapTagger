<p align="justify">
    Welcome to the timestamp correction page. Here you are able to add timestamps to videos and images that do not have a timestamp. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Add a timestamp to a video or image by entering the timestamp in the appropriate fields (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minutes, Seconds). The timestamp will automatically submit 
    after you have entered a value into the seconds field. If you wish to skip a field, you can press the Spacebar to skip the field, where it will 
    move to the next field or submit the timestamp if it is the last field. Please note that a 24-hour clock is used for the timestamp.
</p>
   
<p align="justify">
    If it is not possible to add a timestamp to a video or image, you can skip the video or image by 
    clicking the "Image Has No Timestamp" button or the 'N' hotkey. If you're not able to add timestamps for images and videos from the same camera, you can click the "Camera Has No Timestamp" 
    button or the 'S' hotkey. This will skip all images and videos from the same camera.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If you have made a mistake in adding a timestamp to a video or image, you can press the "Undo" button which will take you back to the previous timestamp.
</p>
