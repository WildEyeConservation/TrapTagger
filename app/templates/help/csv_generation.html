    Here you can generate your own custom CSV file for analysis in third-party applications. You can envisage a csv file as a large table with each row containing a data point, and each 
    column containing a different piece of information about that data point. In fact, a csv file can be opened in Excel and viewed as a table. If you are uncertain about how any 
    of this works, rather use the default csv format available in the results window.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by selecting what each row in the csv file represents: image, capture (a multi image burst taken at a single timestamp by a single camera), cluster, camera, or site.
    Thereafter, you can select how multiple label images/clusters etc. are handled.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>List: The multiple labels are included as a list of labels in a single column. This is the default option.</li>
    <li>Rows: The unit of data (eg. image) is listed multiple times. Once with each label.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Next you can specify a date range for the data you wish to extract. This is useful if you only want to extract data from a specific time period. If you leave the date range blank, 
    all data will be extracted. You can either select both a start and end date, or just a start date or end date. If you only select a start date, all data from that date onwards will be extracted. 
    If you only select an end date, all data up to that date will be extracted. If you select both a start and end date, all data between those dates will be extracted including the start and end dates.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can then choose to include or exclude specific species. This is useful to only extract information for your species of interest, or to exclude vulnerable species such as rhinos 
    from data you need to share with other people.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Next, you can generate some custom columns if you wish. These are typically used to generate unique image/capture/cluster identifiers into a pre-existing database. Begin by 
    selecting "add column" and give that column a name. You can then add a number of pieces of information (using the blue plus button) that will be combined to make your column. 
    In the custom column field you can additionally just add a text field for adding your own text information. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Finally, you can then select your columns of information for each row (image/cluster etc.). By default a name is given to the column based on what you have selected but you can edit the 
    column name to fit your needs. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Note that you can add columns pertaining to the currently-selected row level, or higher. In other words, you can have site-level information such as the site name, 
    added to your image-level rows, but you can't have image-level information such as the image name, added to site-level rows. Also note that the columns in your csv file 
    will match the order in which you stipulate your columns here.
</p>

<div>The information columns you can add are as follows:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Sighting: Sighting ID, Boxes, Flank, Sighting Count, Timestamp, Original Timestamp, Annotator</li>
    <li>Image: File, Image ID, Image URL, Video Path, Sighting Count, Timestamp, Original Timestamp, Annotator</li>
    <li>Capture: Capture Number, Capture ID, Capture URL, Sighting Count, Timestamp, Original Timestamp, Annotator</li>
    <li>Cluster: Cluster ID, Cluster URL, Notes, Sighting Count, Timestamp, Original Timestamp, Annotator</li>
    <li>Camera: Camera Name</li>
    <li>Site: Site Name, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude</li>
    <li>All: Species, Informational Tags, Individuals, Survey Name</li>
</ul>

<div align="justify">
    Besides the (hopefully) self-explanatory columns, the columns are defined as follows:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Sighting Count: The count of the sightings (boxes) in the data unit regardless of species.</li>
    <li>URL: A link you can follow to view the particular image/cluster etc. behind the login page of the website.</li>
    <li>Boxes: The bounding box of the sighting in the image. This contains the Left, Top, Right, Bottom coordinates of the box.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Please note that the CSV file might take a while to generate, especially for larger surveys. Once the CSV file is generated, it will be available for one week for 
    you to download from the Downloads dropdown menu. You can only generate one CSV file at a time for a given annotation set.
