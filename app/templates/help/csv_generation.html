    Here you can generate your own custom CSV file for analysis in third-party applications. You can choose what level of results is contained in each row of the resulting 
    CSV file, along with what columns of information are added to each row.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by selecting the level of information represented by each row of the file: image, cluster, camera, trap group, or survey. Thereafter, you can specify the columns 
    of information presented on each row, in order. This columnar information is further divided into the level it pertains to, where you can add columns pertaining to the 
    currently-selected row level, or higher. In other words, you can have survey-level information such as the survey name, added to your image-level rows, but you 
    can't have image-level information such as the image name, added to survey-level rows.
</p>

<div align="justify">
    The level-by-level information that you can request is as follows:
</div>

<ul>
    <li>Image: image name, species count, labels, and image timestamp.</li>
    <li>Cluster: cluster id, species count, cluster labels, cluster notes, and image count.</li>
    <li>Camera: camera id, species count, labels, animal count, and image count.</li>
    <li>Trap group: trapgroup id, species count, labels, latitude, longitude, altitude, animal count, and image count.</li>
    <li>Survey: survey name, species count, labels, survey description, animal count and image count.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    Besides the self-explanatory columns, these are defined as follows:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Labels: A list of the different labels in the survey/trapgroup/camera/cluster/image.</li>
    <li>Image count: The total number of images in the survey/trapgroup/camera/cluster.</li>
    <li>Animal count: The number of images containing animals in the survey/trapgroup/camera. This excludes Vehicles/Humans/Livestock.</li>
    <li>Species count: The total number of detections of the selected species in the survey/trapgroup/camera/cluster/image, where if you select all, a count for every label will 
    be returned, in a hierarchical order. Note that any count for a parent category will be the number of skipped images in that category, rather than the total number of 
    images in that category.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Note that you cannot select a species count for a particular species if you have already selected an species count for all species at the same level.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Also, please note that the CSV file might take a while to generate, especially for larger surveys, and that any requests for a different CSV format for the same task 
    will overwrite any previous CSVs. So you must wait until your CSV is downloaded before requesting another one for the same task.
