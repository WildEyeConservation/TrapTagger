    Here you can generate your own custom CSV file for analysis in third-party applications. You can envisage a csv file as a large table with each row containing a data point, and each 
    column containing a different piece of information about that data point. In fact, a csv file can be opened in Excel and viewed as a table. If you are uncertain about how any 
    of this works, rather use the default csv format available in the results window.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Begin by adding any additional surveys to your currently selected survey. Next, you can select what each row in the csv file represents: image, capture (a multi image burst taken at 
    a single timestamp by a single camera), cluster, camera, site, or survey. Thereafter, you can select how multiple label images/clusters etc. are handled.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>List: The multiple labels are included as a list of labels in a single column</li>
    <li>Columns: The multiple labels are included as a number of separate columns. This is the default.</li>
    <li>Rows: The unit of data (eg. image) is listed multiple times. Once with each label.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Next you can specify a date range for the data you wish to extract. This is useful if you only want to extract data from a specific time period. If you leave the date range blank, 
    all data will be extracted. You can either select both a start and end date, or just a start date or end date. If you only select a start date, all data from that date onwards will be extracted. 
    If you only select an end date, all data up to that date will be extracted. If you select both a start and end date, all data between those dates will be extracted including the start and end dates.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You can then choose to include or exclude specific species. This is useful to only extract information for your species of interest, or to exclude vulnerable species such as rhinos 
    from data you need to share with other people.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Next, you can generate some custom columns if you wish. These are typically used to generate unique image/capture/cluster identifiers into a pre-existing database. Begin by 
    selecting "add column" and give that column a name. You can then add a number of pieces of information (using the blue plus button) that will be combined to make your column. Each piece of information 
    consists of a data unit (level) and associated information (data). In the custom column field you can additionally just add a text field for adding your own text information. 
    These text fields will then become available (on a per-annotation set basis) when you add your custom column to the columns section.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Finally, you can then select your columns of information for each row (image/cluster etc.). As above, this is done by first selecting a data unit (level), and information relating to 
    that unit (data). For example, if you wish to add site coordinates, you select site (level) and latitude (data) for the first column, and then site (level) and longitude (data) for the second 
    column.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Note that you can add columns pertaining to the currently-selected row level, or higher. In other words, you can have survey-level information such as the survey name, 
    added to your image-level rows, but you can't have image-level information such as the image name, added to survey-level rows. Also Note that the column in your csv file 
    will match the order in which you stipulate your columns here.
</p>

<div>The information columns you can add are as follows:</div>
<ul>
    <li>Image: Name, ID, Species Count, Labels, Sighting Count, Tags, Timestamp, URL, Individuals, Original Timestamp</li>
    <li>Capture: Number, ID, Species Count, Labels, Sighting Count, Tags, Timestamp, Image Count, URL, Individuals</li>
    <li>Cluster: ID, Species Count, Labels, Sighting Count, Tags, Notes, Image Count, URL, Individuals</li>
    <li>Camera: ID, Species Count, Labels, Tags, Animal Count, Image Count, URL, Individuals</li>
    <li>Site: Name, Species Count, Labels, Tags, Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Animal Count, Image Count, URL, Individuals</li>
    <li>Survey: Name, Species Count, Labels, Tags, Description, Animal Count, Image Count, URL, Individuals</li>
</ul>
<br>

<div align="justify">
    Besides the (hopefully) self-explanatory columns, the columns are defined as follows:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>Species Count: The count of the sightings (boxes) of the selected species in each data unit. These will appear as separate species-specific headings such as "lion_count". You 
        can also select to have columns for all species. Note that any count for a parent category will be the number of skipped images (unknown) in that category, rather than the total number of 
        images in that category.</li>
    <li>Sighting Count: The count of the sightings (boxes) in the data unit regardless of species.</li>
    <li>URL: A link you can follow to view the particular image/cluster etc. behind the login page of the website.</li>
    <li>Image Count: The total number of images in the survey/site/camera/cluster/capture.</li>
    <li>Animal Count: The number of images containing animals in the survey/trapgroup/camera. This excludes Vehicles/Humans/Livestock.</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
    Please note that the CSV file might take a while to generate, especially for larger surveys. You cannot navigate away from this page until the download has completed.
    Also note that any requests for a different CSV format for the same annotation set 
    will overwrite any previous CSVs. So you must wait until your CSV is downloaded before requesting another one for the same annotation set.
