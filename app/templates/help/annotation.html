    Welcome to the TrapTagger interface. Here you will identify the animals contained in images from motion-activated camera traps for conservation purposes. 
    For maximum efficiency, you are shown a single sighting of animals at a time as a cluster of images, which you can then cycle through using the 
    previous and next image buttons. When you select a category, that label will apply to the entire cluster of images, and the next cluster will be served to you automatically. 
    Note that you do not need to view every image in a cluster in order to make a classification, unless you are attempting to mark the cluster as empty, or 
    its contents unknown. Lastly, should you make a mistake, simply press the previous cluster button and choose a new category.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    The different categories available to you appear in the form of buttons on the right-hand side of your screen. You can select one by clicking on it, 
    or by pressing its hotkey (displayed in brackets) on your keyboard. <i><b>If you are unable to identify an animal, simply mark it as unknown</b></i>. This applies to 
    sightings where it is impossible to identify the animal, and ones where you do not know the species. It is important that you rather label an animal 
    you are unsure of as unknown, instead of taking a guess.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Further, you should always attempt to <i><b>categorise an animal at the lowest available level</b></i> eg. a lion should be categorised as such, rather than a group category such as small or 
    medium cat.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    You also have the ability to mark a camera as <i><b>knocked down</b></i>. Do this when you notice that a camera has been knocked down by an animal and is taking numerous 
    pictures of nothing. Selection of this label will then remove the rest of the images generated by the camera from the set, and allocate you a new camera trap 
    to evaluate. Please do not mark a camera as knocked down if the camera is still being set up, adjusted, or in the process of being knocked down. 
    In such cases, rather mark the cluster as containing nothing, humans, or the animal doing the knocking down.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    In the case of there being <i><b>multiple species</b></i> in a single cluster of images, simply press the multiple species button. Thereafter you will be able to select 
    as many species categories as necessary. You can also deselect any category by pressing it again, or pressing its hotkey a second time. Once you are satisfied with your 
    selection, you can click the done button to submit your answer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    If any or all of the animals in the cluster are not highlighted by a box - do not worry. These are only there to assist you. Continue to mark the cluster as before.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    Some additional hotkeys:
    <ul style="margin-top:-15px;">
        <li>Enter:              Add a note to the currently-displayed cluster. This can be used to highlight an interesting cluster, or to save information for a bug report should there be something wrong with a cluster.</li>
        <li>Tilde(~):           Previous cluster or undo. This allows you to go back to the previous cluster and change your label for it.</li>
        <li>Delete or [:        Decrease image brightness.</li>
        <li>Insert or ]:        Increase image brightness.</li>
        <li>End or ;:           Decrease image contrast.</li>
        <li>Home or ':          Increase image contrast.</li>
        <li>PageDown or &lt;:   Decrease image saturation.</li>
        <li>PageUp or &gt;:     Increase image saturation.</li>
        <li>Backspace or /:     Reset image brightness, contrast and saturation.</li>
    </ul>
