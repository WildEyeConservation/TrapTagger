    Welcome to the sightings editor. Here you are able to edit the detected animal sightings in your images. Use add, edit, and delete modes to add, edit and delete sightings on an 
    image before commiting those changes to the database. These functionalities can either be accessed using the toolbar on the left-hand side of the image, or by using 
    the hotkeys provided below. You can also change the label associated with a particular sighting by right-clicking on the sighting, and selecting your desired label from 
    the list provided. Should an unexpected species occur in an image, you can access all your labels, in hierarchical order, by selecting the plus option. As previously, 
    you have access to a number of image-identification aids such as image brightness, contrast, and saturation. You can also zoom into the image.
</p>

<p align="justify">
    To update the labels of multiple sightings at once, hold the Ctrl key while clicking on each sighting, then choose the appropriate label on the panel. If no 
    sightings are selected and you apply a label, that label will automatically be assigned to all sightings in the image. This makes it easier to quickly label 
    the majority of sightings and then correct the minority with their appropriate labels.

<div align="justify">Some notes:</div>
<ul align="justify">
    <li>
        You cannot go back to a previous image until the sightings you submitted have been successfully registered. This should not take long, 
        but can potentially take a little time when the server is busy. Please be patient if this is the case.
    </li>
    <li>
        All changes to the labels here will affect the labels associated with the image and its cluster. Thus, if you only have lion sightings in an image who's cluster contains 
        both lion and impala, the cluster will still be labelled with both species, but the image will now only be labelled as containing lion.
    </li>
    <li>
        If an image contains nothing, simply delete all the sightings and by implication, it will be considered empty.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the box associated with one sighting is on top of another, preventing you from clicking on it, simply click the <b>send to back</b> button or press the <b>b</b> key, 
        and click on the offending box. This will send it to the back, allowing you to click on the boxes behind it.
    </li>
