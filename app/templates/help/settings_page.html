<h5>EarthRanger Integration: </h5>
<p>
    The EarthRanger integration allows you to send your TrapTagger data to EarthRanger. To enable this integration, you will need to
    provide an EarthRanger API key. Select the species of interest you would like to send to EarthRanger. After you have selected the species,
    and provided an API key, click the "Save" button to save your settings. TrapTagger will send cluster-level data 
    to EarthRanger for the selected species after an annotation job is completed.
