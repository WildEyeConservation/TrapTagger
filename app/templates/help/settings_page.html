<h5>EarthRanger Integration: </h5>
<p>
    The EarthRanger integration allows you to send your TrapTagger data to EarthRanger. To enable this integration, you will need to
    provide an EarthRanger API key. Select the species of interest you would like to send to EarthRanger. After you have selected the species,
    and provided an API key, click the "Save" button to save your settings. TrapTagger will send cluster-level data 
    to EarthRanger for the selected species after an annotation job is completed.
</p>

<h5>Live Data Integration: </h5>
<p>
    The live data integration allows you to add live images to a survey in TrapTagger. 
    Please select a survey which will be used to store the live data. If you want to use a new survey, go to the Surveys page and create an empty survey 
    (Do not select any files to upload to create an empty survey). After you have selected the survey, click the "Save" button to save your settings. An API key 
    will be generated for you to use in the live data integration. Please note that the API key is only displayed once, so make sure to copy it to a safe place. 
    If you require a new API key, you can select the Generate Key button for the applicable survey. The integration is supported by Gundi.
