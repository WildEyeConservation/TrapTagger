<h5>New Individual</h5>

<p align="justify"> 
    Use this section to create a new individual. A <b>name</b> will be automatically generated, but you can choose to provide 
    a different name if desired. You may also add <b>notes</b> and <b>tags</b> to help with identification or add additional details about the individual.
</p>

<h5>Known Individual</h5>

<p align="justify"> 
    If you are working with a known population and can recognize the individual from the sightings, you can merge the sightings into an existing individual 
    instead of creating a new one. To do this, go to the <b>Known Individual</b> tab and use the available filters to search for the individual. Once youâ€™ve found 
    the correct match, click to select them. You can then review their details, update any notes or tags if needed, and confirm your choice by clicking 
    the <b>Select</b> button. 
</p> 

<p align="justify"> 
    <b>Important:</b> Only use the <b>Known Individual</b> tab if you are confident that the sightings belong to a recognized individual from a known population. 
    In all other cases, use the <b>New Individual</b> tab. AI will assist in identifying individuals in later stages of the pipeline.
