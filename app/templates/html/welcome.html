                Welcome to TrapTagger, a complete camera-trap-annotation and data-analysis web application that is free to use for conservation purposes. Whether you need the accuracy of a manually-annotated 
                dataset, the ease and convenience of an AI-anotated dataset, or any combination inbetween, TrapTagger has you covered. Automatic annotation is achieved using an AI model 
                that has been trained on a dataset of over a million images of Southern African animals, and can identify 56 different species with very high accuracy.
                In general, images are only auto-anotated in cases where the AI is extremely confident, rather leaving the images that it is unsure of for a human to look over.
                This results in around 90% of your dataset being annotated with 99% precision immediately, thus leaving you a relatively small tagging job. On the other hand, 
                should your particular application require greater accuracy levels, you have the option to annotate your entire dataset manually, with the AI simply providing some 
                assistance to make the process easier and more accurate. However, this does not have to be black and white. You are able to individually select which species are 
                automatically annotated, allowing you to have the different-looking species - that wouldn't be confused with your species of interest - removed, leaving you to tag 
                the rest manually (for eg. you could have the elephants, giraffes, and zebras removed when you are interested in lion populations).
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
                The manual annotation process has also been massively streamlined to allow for tiered accuracy levels, with a worker and batch-job architecture that allows for any number of people to 
                sign up for worker accounts and simultaneously annotate your dataset, after you have givien them permission to do so. Moreover, the tagging interface itself is optimised by 
                clustering together all images that constitute a single sighting of a group of animals, and showing you only the heuristically best image from the cluster, along with any other image that may 
                contain another species, thus reducing the number of images that need to be viewed. All high-confidence human and empty images are also removed to drastically reduce the size of the 
                dataset, and prevent you having to look at thousands of empty images. The interface itself is a rapid hotkey-driven process that allows you to tag an entire cluster of images with 
                a single press of a button, whilst AI-generated boxes draw your eyes to the animals immediately, allowing experienced taggers to annotate up to 9000 images per hour.
            </p>

            <p align="justify">
                Finally, once your datset is fully annotated, you have a variety of options to peruse the results. A variety of interactive statistical analyses are provided that allow you to explore 
                the temporal and spatial distributions of the species within the surveyed area. However, should you wish to extract the data for your own statistical analysis, you are able to 
                generate custom-formatted csv files to import into most commercial software.
