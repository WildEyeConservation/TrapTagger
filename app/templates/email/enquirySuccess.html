<ul>
    <li align='justify'>Click Bookmark -> New Bookmark</li>
    <li align='justify'>Select Amazon S3 in the drop down menu at the top of the form</li>
    <li align='justify'>Choose a bookmark nickname if you like</li>
    <li align='justify'>Fill in your Access Key ID</li>
    <li align='justify'>Fill in your Secret Access Key</li>
    <li align='justify'>Click on the 'More Options' arrow</li>
    <li align='justify'>Set the path to traptagger/{{ bucket_name }}</li>
    <li align='justify'>Close the form</li>
    <li align='justify'>Open the bookmark by double clicking on it</li>
    <li align='justify'>Upload a folder by dragging it into the application</li>
</ul>
