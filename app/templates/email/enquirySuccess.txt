Dear {{ organisation }},

A TrapTagger account has been created for you. The credentials are as follows:
Username: {{ organisation }}
Password: {{ password }}
You can follow this link to the login page: {{ url2 }}
If you would like to change your password, please follow this link: {{ url2 }}

Additionally, you have separate credentials to access our cloud storage directly. These are as follows:
Folder: {{ bucket_name }}
Access key ID: {{ s3UserName }}
Secret access key: {{ s3Password }}

The recommended method for uploading images is to do so directly to our cloud storage using third-party software. We recommend using 
CyberDuck (https://cyberduck.io/) as it has both Windows and Mac versions. The setup and upload procedure is as follows:
    -Click Bookmark -> New Bookmark
    -Select Amazon S3 in the drop down menu at the top of the form
    -Choose a bookmark nickname if you like
    -Fill in your Access Key ID
    -Fill in your Secret Access Key
    -Click on the 'More Options' arrow
    -Set the path to traptagger/{{ bucket_name }}
    -Close the form
    -Open the bookmark by double clicking on it
    -Upload a folder by dragging it into the application

If you have any further questions, please send an email to  {{ email_address }}.

Sincerely,
The TrapTagger team
